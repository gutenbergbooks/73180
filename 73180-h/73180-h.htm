<p class="ph3"><i>When the Ship Came In.</i></p>


<p>A warm evening in early June of the year
1812 showed the streets of Baltimore city
gay with groups of people crowding the steps of the
houses, or sauntering up and down from corner to
corner. Slender girls with arms around each other,
circles of children merrily piping out some ring-around-a-rosy,
young men stopping before this or that
door for a few minutes’ chat,—all served to make a
lively scene.</p>

<p>Lettice Hopkins, in short-waisted gown of sprigged
muslin, stood with one slippered foot tapping impatiently
the marble step before her uncle’s door. “Is
yuh see him, Miss Letty?” asked a little colored boy
who stopped his occupation of sliding down the cellar
door to make his inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” Lettice returned petulantly, “and
poor old Mrs. Flynn is moaning and going on because
her Patrick is aboard the vessel, and she thinks he’s
drowned. Run to the corner, Danny, and see if
there is a sign of your master.” She sat down on
the step and looked anxiously in the direction of the
street corner toward which Danny was making his
way, taking time in doing so, and stopping frequently
to switch a chip from the running water in the gutter,
or to send a pebble hopping over the cobblestones.</p>

<p>“It certainly is warm for so early in June,” Lettice
remarked, as she vigorously fanned herself. “You’d
do well to come out here, Aunt Martha,” she continued,
addressing some one in the hall behind her.
“There is a breath outside, but little indoors. Don’t
you think uncle must be here soon? He surely cannot
be at the wharf all this time.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is,” her aunt answered. “It is a
week since the vessel was due, and in good weather
that is too long. It is nothing of a run from here to
Boston and back, and your uncle has reason to be
somewhat anxious, especially in these days.”</p>

<p>“These days,” Lettice repeated; “that is what
father is always saying, as if these were not good
enough days.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins did not answer, but instead, asked,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>“Where is your father?”</p>

<p>“Down at the Fountain Inn, I suppose; it is where
he always goes of an evening. They have a deal to
talk about, it seems, down there.”</p>

<p>“They have, indeed, but isn’t that your uncle
coming now?” Mrs. Hopkins had come out upon the
step and was peering out into the dimly lighted
street.</p>

<p>“To be sure it is,” Lettice replied. “I will go to
meet him, for Mr. Gilmore will stop him if I don’t
get him over on this side of the street.” She started
off with rapid step, her light scarf floating from her
shoulders as she walked.</p>

<p>“She’s in!” shouted Danny, who came running on
ahead of his master.</p>

<p>At this news Lettice slackened her pace and walked
soberly forward to meet her uncle. “Good news, I
hear, Uncle Tom,” she said as she came up to him.</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” he returned, “so far as I am concerned,
but—”</p>

<p>“What?” Lettice interrupted. “Hurry and tell
me, Uncle Tom. What’s wrong? Did anything
happen to the vessel?”</p>

<p>“Not to the vessel, except that she was stopped by
a British cruiser, and three of our men were carried
off as British subjects.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! And who were they? Not Patrick Flynn,
I hope. His mother declares that something has
happened to him, for she has had a certain dream
three nights in succession,—a dream which she insists
forebodes ill.”</p>

<p>“Poor Patrick, indeed; one of the best hands
aboard, and born on American soil, though his
brogue is rich enough for any son of the Emerald
Isle.”</p>

<p>“Alas, poor Patrick! Who will tell his mother?”</p>

<p>“I will, of course,” her uncle quietly replied. And
Lettice hesitating to enter the house, he passed in
before her, spoke a few words to his wife, and then
walked back to where a long garden showed borders
abloom with the roses of June glimmering faintly
from out the dusky green.</p>

<p>Presently arose sounds of wailing and lamenting,
and Lettice, unable to restrain her sympathies, rushed
back to see poor old Mrs. Flynn rocking back and
forth, wringing her hands, and making her moan
over the capture of her son.</p>

<p>“There, Winnie, there,” Lettice heard her uncle
say. “After all, it is not as bad as it would
seem. Pat will find his way back, or I’m mistaken,
and there are plenty of persons who will
tell you he should be proud to serve in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>British navy.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but they’ll be battherin’ the life out av
’im, sorr, an’ be markin’ up his poor back wid the
cat, an’ indade, sorr, I’m thinkin’ he’d betther be
dead than alive.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! not a bit of it. Pat’s too good a hand
for that, and Mr. Joe gave him a word to make no
cause for offence, but to do his duty by the ship he
is on, just the same as if she were the <i>Delight</i>.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a hard day, sorr, when our min must be
dragged from their proper places an’ be put to
wurruk for thim as has no right to be dhrivin’
thim. Not that I’m so down on the ould counthry,
sorr, but I’m not upholdin’ thim British min
stealers, Misther Tom, sorr, an’ it goes agin me
grain for a son o’ mine to be slavin’ for the inimy
av the counthry where he was born.”</p>

<p>Lettice sat down on the step beside the old
woman and began softly to stroke the wrinkled
hand which was nervously fingering the hem of
Mrs. Flynn’s gingham apron. “Never mind, Mrs.
Flynn,” the girl said; “it will be no time before
Patrick will be back again. Why, if he had gone
on a long cruise from this port, you’d not see him
for years, maybe, and this is no worse. Cheer up,
now. Ah, there is Cousin Joe. I’ll bid him come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>out here. I think my father is with him.”</p>

<p>The two men approached, gesticulating excitedly.
“It is an outrage,” Lettice’s father was saying,
“and one that Americans will not stand much
longer. Odious servitude for our citizens! impressed
into a service they despise! our commerce
impeded! insults, injuries of all kinds heaped upon
us! We will not stand it. There will be a war,
sir, for, as the wise Benjamin Franklin so aptly
said, ‘Our War of Independence has yet to be
fought.’”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, William, what was our war of the
Revolution?” put in Mr. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“It was the Revolution. We are not yet free,
if indignity can be offered us which we must
accept silently.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Masther Joe, dear,” whined Winnie, “ye
let thim steal me bhy.” Joseph Hopkins, a tall
young fellow, sunburnt and stalwart, looked down
at her with kindly eyes. “Indeed, Winnie, I did
my best to save him and two others, but it was
no use.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it, Cousin Joe,” said Lettice.</p>

<p>“I have told the tale more than once, cousin,
but since you and Winnie will likely give me no
peace till I tell it again, I’ll spin you my yarn.
We were just turning into the bay, after having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
had to go out of our way to escape from the
clutches of more than one British cruiser, when
we saw a sail which gave us chase, and though
the <i>Delight</i> was in her own waters, our pursuers
were within gunshot in a short time. Then they
demanded to search us for deserters. At first I
refused, as I knew father would have me do; but
we were scarcely prepared to fight a ship of the
size of the enemy, and discretion being the better
part of valor, and to save a whole skin for the
majority of my crew, at last it seemed best to
submit to the demand. So poor Patrick, Johnny
Carter, as good an Eastern-shoreman as ever lived,
and Dick Bump, who never saw the plank of a
British ship before, were carried off. Every
mother’s son of them was born on American
soil, and they were claimed as British subjects.
It is an outrage! But trust to Pat, Mrs. Flynn,
he’ll be with us again before long, or my name’s
not Joe Hopkins. I saw Uncle Edward in Boston,
mother,” he went on to say, “and he promised
to come on with the next ship.”</p>

<p>Leaving Mrs. Flynn somewhat comforted, the
others took their way again to the front steps,
where the men plunged into a discussion of the
questions of the day, and Lettice, who cared little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
for letters-of-marque and general reprisals, sat
watching the passers-by, once in a while putting
a question when the talk became particularly
exciting.</p>

<p>She had come up from the Eastern shore of
Maryland but a few months before, and had
hardly yet become accustomed to life in a big
city, having always lived upon the plantation now
managed by her eldest brother. The marriage of
this big brother had eventually brought about the
change which made of Lettice a city girl, for her
father concluded to join his brother in Baltimore,
and Lettice must perforce accompany him. It
was not altogether a happy arrangement for the
girl; her uncle’s wife was a New England woman,
and did not understand her husband’s light-hearted
little niece, over whom she was disposed
to exert an authority which Lettice, if she had
been less sweet-tempered, would have resented.
Then, too, Aunt Martha did not like negro servants,
and Lettice knew no others. Nevertheless,
she made friends with old Mrs. Flynn, who
reigned over the kitchen, and the other maids did
not count, she told her father.</p>

<p>She sat on the step, her thoughts travelling to
her old home. How pleasant it must be there this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
hot night, she reflected, with the bay in sight, and
the moon shining down upon it. She would like
to be dashing down the long level road upon her
pretty bay mare, and after a while to come in and
find Mammy waiting for her with some cooling drink,
and Lutie ready to undress her. She wished Aunt
Martha would let her have Lutie, or she wished her
father would let her keep house for him and have
the old servants about her. Perhaps he would in
another year, for she would be seventeen then.</p>

<p>She was aroused from her revery by her father
saying: “War? yes, war say I. Joe, I told you,
didn’t I, of our meeting at Fountain Inn, and of
our resolutions upon the subject? ‘No alternative
between war and degradation’ we decided.”</p>

<p>“Oh, father,” put in Lettice, “is there really to
be war? I thought it was only talk.”</p>

<p>“Pray God not. There’s been too much talk;
now is the time for action.”</p>

<p>“And shall you go and fight? And Cousin Joe
and Uncle Tom, will they go too?”</p>

<p>“If we are needed, yes. I can answer for all of
us.”</p>

<p>Lettice slipped her arm across the back of her
father’s chair. “Oh, father, dear, you’ll not go and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>leave me all alone?”</p>

<p>“Not all alone, with your Aunt Martha and the
servants,” spoke up her Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>Lettice looked down a little confused, but her
Cousin Joe changed the subject by saying, “They
are not for war in Boston, Uncle William.”</p>

<p>“So I am told; and that Massachusetts, so valiant
in the Revolution, should be willing tamely to submit
to England’s insults, is beyond my belief. I cannot
understand her indifference.”</p>

<p>“A war with England would touch her pocket-book
too nearly,” Joe replied, laughing.</p>

<p>“Yes, it would interfere with her trade, and she
has not the other resources that we have,” said Mr.
Tom Hopkins, reflectively. “I suspect that you had
more than one controversy with Edward, Joe.”</p>

<p>“That I did; and he’ll soon be on his way here
to resume the argument.”</p>

<p>“Does he bring Rhoda with him?” asked Mrs.
Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Yes, so he said.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be a companion for you, Lettice,” said
Mrs. Hopkins. “She is but a year older. We
must try to keep her here for a good long visit.
I’ve not seen Rhoda for five years, but she was a
very good child then, and I have no doubt will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>a useful influence for you.”</p>

<p>Lettice touched her cousin’s arm. “Come, walk
to the corner with me,” she said. “I’m tired of
sitting still, and you all talk nothing but politics.”</p>

<p>“You’d rather the subject would be dress, I
fancy,” Mrs. Hopkins remarked, with a little severity.</p>

<p>“To be sure I would,” Lettice laughed, as she
walked off. “Sometimes I feel as if I must be
saucy to Aunt Martha,” she said to her cousin.
“Tell me about Rhoda, Cousin Joe. Is she pretty?
What does she look like?”</p>

<p>“She is fair, with light hair and blue eyes. She is
rather slight, and is quiet in her manner. She does
not talk very much unless she is deeply interested,
and then she is very earnest.”</p>

<p>“Then there will be a chance for my chatter,”
returned Lettice, the dimples showing around her
rosy mouth. “Does she wear her hair in curls, as
I do, Cousin Joe?”</p>

<p>“No, she wears it quite plainly.”</p>

<p>“And is she tall?”</p>

<p>“Yes, rather so.”</p>

<p>“Taller than I?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you are not above what I should call
medium height.”</p>

<p>“I may grow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“True; there is time for that.”</p>

<p>“Should you like me better then?” Lettice gave
a side glance, and then dropped her curly black lashes
over her big blue eyes.</p>

<p>Her cousin laughed. “You would coquet even
with me, I verily believe; with me, who am as good
as married.”</p>

<p>The violet eyes opened wide. “I am not trying
to at all. Would I coquet with my blood cousin,
who, moreover, is a double cousin?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, if you could help it; but you do
coquet even with Pat Flynn.”</p>

<p>“Now, Cousin Joe, you are trying to tease me.”</p>

<p>“And with Mrs. Flynn,” Joe continued, “and
your father and your brothers.”</p>

<p>“My brothers—That reminds me, Cousin Joe,
that if there is going to be a war, I suppose they
will want to fight too. Alas! I’ve a mind to turn
Yankee and cry down war.”</p>

<p>“And let Patrick go unavenged, after all the sweet
looks you have cast on him and the honeyed words
to his mother?”</p>

<p>“Quit your nonsense, sir. You know I would
never give soft glances to a common sailor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, and what am I?”</p>

<p>“No common sailor, but an uncommonly pert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>young gentleman. You may walk to Julia Gittings’s
with me, and there leave me; I’ll warrant her brother
will see me home.”</p>

<p>“I warrant he will if I give him a chance, but I’ve
no notion of deserting you, Cousin Lettice. You
asked me to walk with you, and I’ll complete my part
of the contract.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave him a soft little dab with her white
fingers, and another moment brought them to a standstill
before one of the comfortable houses fronting
the square below their own home. They found Miss
Julia surrounded by a bevy of young gentlemen in
short-waisted coats, and by as many young ladies in
as short-waisted gowns.</p>

<p>“Law, Lettice, is it you?” cried Julia. “Have
you heard the news? They say we’ll surely have
war. Won’t it be exciting! Howdy, Mr. Joe.
Come sit here and tell me of your exploits. Mr.
Emery has just been trying to fool us by relating
a story of your being overhauled by the
British.”</p>

<p>“It is true. Isn’t it, Joe?” spoke up one of
the young men.</p>

<p>“True enough, as three of my boys have sad
reason to know,” Joe replied. And then again
must an account of his experiences be given, amid
soft ejaculations from the girls and more emphatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
ones from the young men. It was not a specially
new theme, but one that had not come home to
them before, and not a youth that did not walk
away toward his home that night with a determination
to avenge the outrage at the first opportunity.
The next day came the news that war was declared.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>The Work of a Mob.</i></p>


<p>Within the week Rhoda Kendall arrived
with her father from Boston. As her
Cousin Joe had described her, Lettice was not
surprised to meet a quiet, reserved girl. By the
side of Lettice’s dark hair, pink and white complexion,
and deep blue eyes, Rhoda’s coloring
seemed very neutral, yet the New England girl
was by no means as supine as her appearance
would indicate, as Lettice soon found out; for
before twenty-four hours were over she was arguing
with her new acquaintance in a crisp, decided
manner, and was so well-informed, so clever with
facts and dates, that Lettice retired from the field
sadly worsted, but with the fire of an ambitious
resolve kindled within her.</p>

<p>“She made me feel about two inches high,”
she told her father, “and I appeared a perfect
ignoramus. Why don’t I know all those things
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>about politics and history, father?”</p>

<p>“Go along, child,” he replied. “Deliver me
from a clever woman! Learn to be a good housewife,
and be pretty and amiable, and you’ll do.”</p>

<p>“No, but I’ll not do,” Lettice persisted. “I
am not going to let that Boston girl make me
feel as small as a mouse, and I don’t mean to sit
as mum as an owl while she entertains the gentlemen
with her knowledge of affairs. She’ll be
having them all desert our side yet.”</p>

<p>Her father laughed. “That’s the way the crow
flies, is it? My little lass is like to be jealous,
and she’ll have no one stealing her swains from her.
I see. Well, my love, what do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“I want to know why we shouldn’t have war.
When I listen to Rhoda, she fairly persuades me
that we would be a blundering, senseless lot, to
war with a great nation like England. She has
such a big navy, and we have none to speak of,
Rhoda says, and she laughs when I say we won’t
let ourselves be beaten. We will not, will we,
father?”</p>

<p>“No, we will <i>not</i>,” he emphasized; “and as for
our navy, we have not a bad record. Their ships
can sail no faster and are no better manned than
ours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“I’d like to see any one manage a vessel better
than you or Uncle Tom, and even Brother William
or Brother James, and Cousin Tom can do
anything with one of our clippers. Why, they
are as much at home on the water as on the
land.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. There are no better seamen anywhere
than America can produce, and we can
show fight. At all events, daughter, we do not
mean to be bullied, and though New England
has little mind to help us, we’ll make our fight on
righteous grounds of complaint.”</p>

<p>“But won’t our trade be spoiled? Rhoda says
so.”</p>

<p>“You let me talk to Rhoda,” said Mr. Hopkins,
rising, “and leave politics alone, little one. Run
along and help your aunt.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t want any help, and she doesn’t
like me to be in the kitchen. Father, dear, when
shall I be old enough to keep house for you, and
have Aunt Dorky, and Lutie, and all of them for
our servants?”</p>

<p>He put his arm around her caressingly. “We
cannot think of such things till this war matter is
settled, my pet. I must be on hand to serve if
need be, and I couldn’t leave my little girl alone,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>you know.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could fight,” said Lettice, solemnly.</p>

<p>Her father smiled. “Pray heaven that you’ll
never see fight,” he said.</p>

<p>But Lettice was soon to see the first effects of
war, for the following evening Rhoda’s father came
in and pulled a paper out of his pocket as he sat
down to the table. “What do you think of this,
Tom?” he said. “There’s a level-headed man for
you!” and he read: “We mean to use every constitutional
argument and every legal means to
render as odious and suspicious to the American
people, as they deserve to be, the patrons and contrivers
of this highly impolitic and destructive war,
in the full persuasion that we shall be supported
and ultimately applauded by nine-tenths of our
countrymen, and that our silence would be treason
to them.”</p>

<p>“What do I think of that?” said Mr. Hopkins,
“I think that Mr. Hanson is laying up trouble for
himself, for I suppose that is the <i>Federal Republican</i>
you have there.”</p>

<p>“It is, and I fully agree with Mr. Hanson, if he
is the editor.”</p>

<p>“You of Massachusetts may, but we of Maryland
do not,” returned Mr. Hopkins, with some heat;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>“and Mr. Hanson will find out to his cost that he
cannot disseminate such a publication without
endangering himself and his property.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, on the following Monday evening a
party of indignant citizens destroyed the type,
presses, paper, etc., of the <i>Federal Republican</i>, and
razed the house to its foundations, following out
Mr. Hopkins’s predictions.</p>

<p>“Outrageous!” cried Rhoda, when she heard the
reports. “What a lawless set you are here.”</p>

<p>“Almost as much so as you were up in Boston
some forty years ago,” retorted her Cousin Joe,
lazily, at which Rhoda’s pale blue eyes flashed, and
she set her lips defiantly.</p>

<p>“You are talking nonsense!” she said. “That was
for our liberty, and this is but the furthering an
unnecessary conflict which will ruin the country
our fathers so bravely fought for.”</p>

<p>“And for which our fathers will bravely fight
again, won’t they, Cousin Joe?” Lettice broke in.
“Mine will, I know, although I don’t suppose
yours will, Rhoda.”</p>

<p>“Sh! Sh!” cried Mrs. Hopkins. “Don’t quarrel,
children. I hoped you two girls would be good
friends, but you are forever sparring. You are not
very polite, Lettice. You’ll be sending Rhoda home
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>with a poor opinion of Southern hospitality.”</p>

<p>This touched Lettice to the quick. She looked
up archly from under her long lashes. “Then I’ll
be good, Rhoda,” she said. “Come, we’ll go to
market for aunt. I want you to see our Marsh
market. Strangers think it is a real pretty one.”
And the two girls departed, Lettice with basket
on arm, curls dancing, and step light; Rhoda with
a deep consciousness of the proprieties, giving not
so much as a side glance to the young blades who
eyed them admiringly as they passed down Market
Street. But Lettice dimpled and smiled as this or
that acquaintance doffed his hat, so that presently
Rhoda said sarcastically, “It is plain to see why
you like to come to market, Lettice.”</p>

<p>“And why?” asked Lettice, opening her eyes.</p>

<p>“Because of the many pretty bows you receive.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave her head a little toss, and then asked,
a trifle wickedly, “Is it then a new experience to
you to count on receiving a bow from a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Rhoda, somewhat nettled; “but
from so many.”</p>

<p>“Oh, so many; then you girls in Boston cannot
account your acquaintances by the dozen.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want to,” returned Rhoda, shortly.
“We are not so lavish of our smiles as to bestow
them upon every masculine we meet.”</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>
<p>“That’s where you lose a great deal,” replied
Lettice, suavely. “Now, I’ve been taught to be
sweetly polite to everybody, and my father would
bow as courteously to Mrs. Flynn as to Mrs. Dolly
Madison, and so would my brothers.”</p>

<p>“You have two brothers, I believe,” said Rhoda,
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes; one has not been long married and lives
at our old home in eastern Maryland.”</p>

<p>“A farm?”</p>

<p>“A tobacco plantation, although we raise other
crops. My younger brother, James, lives there,
too.”</p>

<p>“And how old is he?”</p>

<p>“Old enough to be a very fitting beau for you,”
laughed Lettice.</p>

<p>Rhoda frowned, to Lettice’s delight. “Why don’t
you say, Such frivolity! that is what Aunt Martha
always says when I mention beaux. One would
suppose it a wicked thing to marry or to receive a
gentleman’s attention. I wonder how Aunt Martha
ever brought herself to the point of becoming
Uncle Tom’s second wife; but I believe she says
he carried her by storm, and she was surprised into
saying yes. How do the young men carry on such
things up your way, Rhoda? Do they sit and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
tweedle their thumbs and cast sheep’s eyes at you,
as some of our country bumpkins do? or do they
make love to the mother, as I have heard is the
custom in some places?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Lettice, how your thoughts do run
on such things! Is that the market?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and now you will see as fine a display as
you could wish.”</p>

<p>A moment after Lettice had become the careful
housewife, selecting her various articles with great
judgment, tasting butter, scrutinizing strawberries
to be sure their caps were fresh and green, lifting
with delicate finger the gills of a fish to see if they
were properly red, and quite surprising Rhoda by her
knowledge of and interest in articles of food.</p>

<p>“One would suppose you were the housekeeper,”
she said to Lettice. “How did you learn all those
things?”</p>

<p>“My mother taught me some, and our old cook
others. My mother considered certain matters of
housekeeping the first for a girl to learn, and I hope
to keep house for my father in another year, if this
wretched war is over then.”</p>

<p>“War!” replied Rhoda, scornfully. “It is so absurd
to talk of war.” But not many days after came the
first ominous outburst of the future storm. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
on July 27, about twilight, that Lettice and Rhoda,
who were slowly sauntering up and down the pavement,
saw a crowd beginning to gather before a
respectable-looking house on Charles Street.</p>

<p>“I wonder what can be the matter,” said Lettice,
pausing in her account of a fox-hunt. “Do you see
yonder crowd, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let us go and find out what it means.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” And Lettice, who had surprised Rhoda
by telling how she could take a ditch, was not ready
to cross the street to join the crowd.</p>

<p>“There can’t be any danger,” said Rhoda.</p>

<p>“Oh, but there is. See there, Rhoda, they are
throwing stones at the windows. Oh, I see, it is the
house which Mr. Hanson now occupies, since they
tore down his printing-press. Oh, this is dreadful!
Come, Rhoda, run, run; the crowd is growing larger;
we’ll be caught in the midst of it.”</p>

<p>But Rhoda still hesitated. “Is that the gentleman
whose paper my father commended?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hanson? Yes, it is; he is the editor of the
<i>Federal Republican</i>, and it is evident that he has
written something to enrage his enemies. Come,
Rhoda, do come. I am afraid we shall be hurt, and
anyhow, we must not mingle in such a rabble. I’m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>going to run,” and suiting the action to the word,
she ran swiftly along the street toward home, Rhoda
following at a slower gait.</p>

<p>They met their Cousin Joe hurrying toward them.
“Oh, Cousin Joe, Cousin Joe,” cried Lettice, grasping
his arm, “there is something dreadful going on!
Take us home! I am scared! I don’t want to see or
hear what they are doing. They are throwing stones
at Mr. Hanson’s house, and are breaking the windows,
and yelling and howling like mad! Listen! What do
they mean to do? Why are they so fierce? I am so
afraid some one will be killed.”</p>

<p>“It means that war has begun,” said her cousin,
slowly.</p>

<p>“But what a way to do it!” said Rhoda, indignantly.
“A rabble like that, to attack a few innocent people!”</p>

<p>“Innocent from your point of view, but not from
the mob’s.”</p>

<p>“You uphold the mob?”</p>

<p>“No; but I don’t uphold the utterances of the
<i>Federal Republican</i>. Come home, girls, and don’t
poke your noses out of doors, or at least don’t leave
our own front doorstep.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not,” cried Lettice, clinging to him. “I
will go out into the garden and sit there. Where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>are my father and Uncle Tom?”</p>

<p>“They have gone down to see Major Barney,
to inquire what can be done about this disturbance.
I will keep you informed about what goes
on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go back into that mob, Cousin Joe,”
Lettice begged. “You might get killed.”</p>

<p>“I must see what is going on, but I will take
no part in violence.”</p>

<p>“But what would Patsey say?” Lettice asked
half archly.</p>

<p>Joe looked down at her with a little smile.
“If she is the brave girl I take her for, she’ll
trust to my good sense to look out for myself.”</p>

<p>“But they are firing from the house. Listen!
you can hear the reports.”</p>

<p>Joe listened, and then he said, “I will not go
too near, little cousin. I promise you that. Run
in now.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come back and tell us if anything more
serious happens,” said Rhoda. “I wish my father
were not in Washington.”</p>

<p>“He’s better off there,” Joe assured her. “For
my part, I am thankful he is not here.”</p>

<p>The girls retired to the garden at the back of
the house. Danny with wide-open eyes peeped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>out of one of the lower windows. “What’s de
matter, Miss Letty?” he asked in a loud whisper.
“Is dey fightin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes; at least there is a riot out there. Some
people are attacking the house where Mr. Hanson
is—Mr. Wagner’s house on Charles Street. It
began by a rabble of boys throwing stones and
calling names.”</p>

<p>“Golly, but I wisht I’d been there!”</p>

<p>“Danny, go back to bed, and don’t get up again,”
his mistress ordered.</p>

<p>Danny crawled reluctantly down from his place
on the window-sill. “Whar Mars Torm?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“He has gone down town,” Lettice informed
him.</p>

<p>Danny still hung back. “Miss Letty,” he whispered.
She went a few steps toward him, despite
her aunt’s reproving voice, “You and your Uncle
Tom ruin that boy, Lettice.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Danny?” Lettice asked.</p>

<p>“Ef anythin’ tur’ble happen, I skeered you all
gwine leave me hyar.”</p>

<p>Lettice laughed. “There isn’t anything terrible
going to happen to this house, and if there should,
I’ll let you know, you needn’t be scared, Danny.”</p>

<p>The noise in the street increased. As yet no military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
appeared to quell the mob. Mrs. Flynn, worked
up into a great state of excitement, trotted from
corner to corner, coming back so often to report
that it would seem as if she would wear herself
out. “There be a gintleman addhressin’ the crowd,
Mrs. Hopkins, mum,” she said.</p>

<p>“They do say they’ll be rig’lar foightin’ nixt.
Glory be to Pether! but hear thim cracks av the
goons!” And back she trotted to return with:
“Howly mother av Moses! they’re murtherin’ the
payple in the streets. A gintleman, be name
Dr. Gale, is kilt intoirely, an’ siveral others is
hurthed bad, an’ the crowd is runnin’ in ivery
direction. Do ye hear thim drooms a-beatin’?
I’ll be afther seein’ what’s that for.” And out
she went again.</p>

<p>“Come, girls, go to bed,” said Mrs. Hopkins.
“It is near midnight, and you can do no good by
sitting up. I wish Mr. Hopkins would come in.”</p>

<p>But neither Mr. Tom Hopkins nor his brother
appeared that night, and all through their troubled
slumbers the girls heard groans and hoarse cries,
and the sound of a surging mass of angry men
bent on satisfying their lust for revenge. Even
with the dawn the horrors continued to be carried
on throughout the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>It was not till late in the afternoon that
Mr. Tom Hopkins returned home. He looked
pale and troubled. “We have heard terrible reports,
Uncle Tom,” said Rhoda. “Is it really
true that some of your most respectable citizens
have been murdered by a brutal horde of lawless
villains, and that they have been tortured and
almost torn limb from limb?”</p>

<p>“I fear there is much truth in it,” he replied
gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh!” The tears welled up into Letty’s eyes.
“Is General Lingan killed, and General Lee? Oh,
Uncle Tom, is it so dreadful as that? And where
is my father?”</p>

<p>“He is with Major Barney. General Lingan, I
fear, is killed. General Lee, I am not so sure
about. I hope he is safe. There has been much
wrong done, and an ill-advised mob is hard to
quell, especially when it is a principle rather than
a personal grudge which is involved, because it is
the whole mind of the party which works with
equal interest. I regret exceedingly the manner
of their opposition to Mr. Hanson’s paper, but—”
He frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>Rhoda fired up. “It is a disgrace. I should
think you would feel it to be a blot on your city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
and state, that such things have been allowed by
the authorities. I wish I had never come to this
place, peopled by a set of villanous murderers.”</p>

<p>“Rhoda!” Her aunt spoke reprovingly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care.” Rhoda’s cheeks were flushed.
“It is true. It is a dreadful, dreadful thing to
murder men for saying they will not countenance
a war with England.”</p>

<p>“It is a dreadful thing,” returned her uncle,
“but we have many wrongs to avenge. Our poor
seamen have been flogged to death, have been as
brutally treated as this mob has treated the Federalists,
and a desire for vengeance which will not
be satisfied with less than an eye for an eye, is
the motive power which has controlled these late
horrible scenes. It is the first battle of our war
for freedom, ill-advised as it is.”</p>

<p>Lettice was sobbing nervously. “I want to go
home, too,” she cried, “I don’t want to stay
here, either. I want to go home, Uncle Tom.
I am afraid more dreadful things will happen.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so, too, and I think you would all
be safer and more at ease down in the country.
I think, Martha, you had better take the girls and
go down to Sylvia’s Ramble as soon as you can
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>get off.”</p>

<p>“And leave you?”</p>

<p>“I am safe enough; at least, if need comes, you
know what I shall do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p>“At all events,” continued Mr. Hopkins, “you
all will be better off in the country, and I will
come down as soon as I can feel free to do so.”</p>

<p>Then Lettice dried her eyes, and while Rhoda
was protesting that she could not go away in the
absence of her father, Mr. Kendall walked in.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>On the Bay.</i></p>


<p>The curiously indented shore of the Chesapeake
Bay presents a country so full of little
rivers and inlets that it is oftener easier to cut
across a narrow channel by boat than to drive
from one place to another. Especially is this true
of the Eastern shore: in consequence, the dwellers
thereon are as much at home on the water as on
the land, and are famous sailors. This Rhoda
soon discovered, and was filled with amazement to
find that Lettice could manage a sailing vessel
nearly as well as could her brothers.</p>

<p>It was much against Rhoda’s will that she finally
made ready to accompany her aunt and Lettice
to the country. Her father informed her that he
must return to Washington, and though she begged
to be allowed to go with him, he said she would be
better off in the hands of her aunt, and he would
join her at Sylvia’s Ramble a little later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Tom Hopkins’s plantation lay next to his
brother’s. The two formed part of an original
tract granted by Lord Baltimore to an ancestor of
the Hopkins family. Part of the land lay along the
bay, and one or two small creeks ran up from
the larger body of water, so that when one approached
the houses, it seemed as if a vessel must
be moored in the back yard, for tall spars shot up
behind the chimneys, seemingly out of a mass of
green. Rhoda’s puzzled look upon being told that
their destination was the next place made Lettice
ask what was wrong.</p>

<p>“What in the world is it that looks so curious?”
said Rhoda. “Aunt Martha tells me that the
house is the next one, and surely that is a vessel
behind it? Do you use ships for barns?”</p>

<p>Lettice laughed. “You will see when we get
there. We don’t land in the creek. Uncle Tom
has a landing this side, on the bay shore. Just
there it is.”</p>

<p>Their little sailing vessel was gliding in, having
passed Kent Island on the left. The fresh breeze
had brought them down in a comparatively short
time, and Lettice was soon scanning the small
wharf to see who stood to meet them. “There’s
Brother James,” she cried; “and I do believe it is
Patsey Ringgold herself, Cousin Joe. Yes, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
she sits on her white horse.” And almost before
the boat had touched the sands, Lettice was ashore,
crying: “Howdy, Brother James! Howdy, Patsey.
Here we are, safe and sound, and so glad to get
here.”</p>

<p>A warm color came into the face of the
girl sitting on her horse ready to welcome them,
and she slid down, before James could help her,
to be heartily kissed and embraced by Lettice, who
said: “I am dying to hear the neighborhood news,
and, Patsey dear, there is so much to tell you, and
I have brought a new sleeve pattern, and oh, tell
me, have the gowns come home yet?”</p>

<p>“They are on the way,” Patsey told her. “Who
is the young lady, Lettice?”</p>

<p>“That is Rhoda Kendall, my Aunt Martha’s niece,
from Boston. I see Brother James is already making
his manners to her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of her,” returned Patsey;
“but I wonder that she should come down here
just now.”</p>

<p>“Her father is obliged to be in Washington,
and thought it safer that she should come down
here with us, since there are such troubles in the
city.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“Troubles, yes; and there are like to be more of
them, if what we hear is true. Every one is talking
of the war, and the planters are making ready for
defence.”</p>

<p>“And they are sending out vessels from Baltimore
to chase the British cruisers; Cousin Joe—” Lettice
paused, for Patsey cast an apprehensive look at the
tall figure then stepping over the side of the vessel.
“Cousin Joe,” Lettice repeated, “will tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>Up toward a white house set in a grove of locust
trees, they all took their way, attended by an escort
of negroes, big and little, who lugged along whatever
was portable. Lettice linked her arm in that of her
brother, when her Cousin Joe joined Patsey, and this
youngest pair fell behind the rest. “You’ll take
me straight home, Jamie dear, won’t you?” Lettice
coaxed. “I do so want to see Sister Betty and the
baby, and Brother William, and oh, so many things!
You don’t know how glad I am to get back! Does
Betty make a good housekeeper, and has she changed
the place much?”</p>

<p>“No, very little,” her brother made reply; “and,
yes, she is a fair housekeeper; perhaps not so good
as our mother was, but Betty has some years before
she will need to have great things expected of her.
How is father? and what is this I hear of his going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
to join the troops? Joe says Uncle Tom is talking
of going, too.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave a little start. “I knew they talked of
it, but I didn’t know it meant that they would go soon.
Do they really mean to join the army at once?”</p>

<p>“So Joe says.”</p>

<p>“And will you go? and Brother William?” Lettice
asked in visible distress.</p>

<p>“If we are needed. They are getting up companies
everywhere, to protect the state.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave a deep sigh, and clung closer to him.
He was a pleasant-looking lad of eighteen, with
curling, ruddy brown locks and fearless blue eyes,
and with such a winning, careless, happy nature as
caused many a little lass to give her smiles to him.
“So you don’t want to stay under Aunt Martha’s
wing any longer,” he said, smiling.</p>

<p>“No, I’d rather be under Betty’s. Does she know
I am coming?”</p>

<p>“She expects you, and is in a twitter of delight
over having you back again with us.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t let us tarry.” And, indeed, she cut
her good-bys very short, and with her brother was
soon cutting across fields to her old home, there
to be welcomed joyously by Sister Betty and the
servants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“I declare, Letty, you grow like a weed!” was
Betty’s greeting as, with her baby in her arms, she
came into her sister-in-law’s room that evening, to
watch her make her evening toilet. “Have you
many pretty things?”</p>

<p>“A few. Aunt Martha doesn’t encourage extravagance
in dress.” Lettice drew down the corners
of her mouth and dropped her eyes in a little prim
way, while Betty laughed.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! she is an old Puritan. It is natural
for girls to like pretty things, just as it is for babies
to want to catch at something bright. Isn’t it, my
pretty?” And Betty gave her cooing baby a hug,
as he vainly tried to clutch the shining chain his
mother had been dangling before him. Lettice
smiled and surveyed her dainty little figure complacently,
then held out her hands for the baby.</p>

<p>“No, don’t take him now,” said Betty; “he’ll
rumple your pretty frock. He’d rather be with his
mammy than either of us, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Is dear old Dorcas his mammy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course; ‘she done nuss de whole mess
o’ Hopkins, an’ she right spry yet,’” replied Betty,
laughing. “Come, let’s go find her. William will
be coming in pretty soon, and I must be ready to
meet him, and oh, Lettice, I remembered how fond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
you were of buttermilk, and I told Randy to put a
bucket of it down the well to keep cool for you.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave a sigh of content and followed her
sister-in-law down the broad stairway. It was so
good to be at home again; to see the table set with
the familiar dishes, and Speery standing there with a
green branch beating away the flies. Speery giggled
gleefully as she caught sight of the figure which had
paused before the door. “Law, Miss Letty, yuh is
a gran’ young lady, sho ’nough,” she said. “I mos’
skeered to speak to yuh.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t be, Speery,” Lettice replied, her
eyes wandering over the dark mahogany furniture,
and returning to take in the details of old silver and
India china upon the table. “Is that one of Miss
Betty’s wedding presents—that pitcher? How
pretty it is.”</p>

<p>“Yass, miss, dat one o’ ’em. I done fergit who
given it to ’er.”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget my buttermilk, Speery,” said Lettice,
as she turned away.</p>

<p>“Naw, miss,” giggled Speery. And then Lettice
went out on the porch to be hugged and kissed by
her big brother, she declaring that even though she
could no longer lay claim to being the baby of the
family, she meant to be as much of a pet as ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>But at the table the talk became very serious, and
a cloud settled on Betty’s fair brow as her husband
questioned minutely as to the trouble in the city,
and when, after supper, they all gathered on the
porch to get the cool breezes from the bay, Betty
drew very close to William, and, despite the gladness
of her home-coming, Lettice felt that she was
not beyond an atmosphere of anxious dread, even
here in this quiet corner of the world.</p>

<p>Rhoda chafed at being obliged to remain in a community
of fire-eaters, as she called them, to James’s
amusement. The lad loved to tease, and more than
once brought tears of rage to Rhoda’s eyes. She
liked him, too; perhaps that was the reason he could
so easily annoy her. His curly head was wont to
appear very often over the railing of the porch at
Sylvia’s Ramble, and his greeting was usually,
“Howdy, Miss Rhoda, have you heard the news?”</p>

<p>“No,” Rhoda invariably returned, looking around
sharply. And then James would lean indolently
against the porch and gaze up at her with a beguiling
expression in his eyes, and would make some
such remark as, “They say Massachusetts is getting
ready to secede.”</p>

<p>Then Rhoda would turn away with a fling and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>say, “I don’t believe a word of it!”</p>

<p>“If she does, you’ll stay down here with us,
won’t you, Miss Rhoda?” James would say, giving
her one of his fetching glances. Then Rhoda
would look confused, and say that she would call
her aunt.</p>

<p>Once or twice they quarrelled in good earnest,
for Rhoda pretended to despise everything which
savored of the South, while James never failed to
sound Maryland’s praises. “You know,” he said
one day, “Maryland is mighty plucky. She stood
out against you all in 1778, when the question of
setting a limit to Western lands came up. You
know she wouldn’t yield an inch, and was the
only one of the states that stood up for the public
good against all odds. She just wouldn’t, and she
wouldn’t join the confederation of states unless
they’d come around to her way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” returned Rhoda, but half convinced.
“I never heard so much talk about nothing. We
never hear that discussed up our way.”</p>

<p>“Course not,” James answered. “Good reason
why. Massachusetts was one of the states that
held Western lands. When did she ever want to
give up anything for the public good?”</p>

<p>“When did she? You are crazy to talk so!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>You forget Lexington and Bunker Hill.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” James’s eyes twinkled. “That’s
what you always say. One would think you all
up there had won the independence of the colonies
by your two or three little skirmishes. The
real battles took place farther south than New
England. Precious little she suffered compared
to the Southern states! We’d never have won
if the South hadn’t given Washington, and hadn’t
sent their troops and their supplies and their help
of all kinds to get you out of your scrape up
there. I think you are right-down ungrateful to
us. Why, laws, child, you didn’t know anything
about fighting up there. They didn’t get at it hot
and heavy till the war left Massachusetts soil.
You have no reason to be stuck up over your
little old Bunker Hill.”</p>

<p>“We began the war, anyhow,” retorted Rhoda.</p>

<p>“You flatter yourselves. The Regulators in
North Carolina did the starting.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t till after our Stamp Act riot.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough; you score one there. At all
events, you would still be under England’s dominion
if we hadn’t come to your aid; though from
the looks of it, that’s where you want to be, and
your Bunker Hill will go for nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Then Rhoda arose in a towering rage. “You
are a detestable creature! I wish I had never
seen you. If I were a man, I’d—I’d fight a duel
with you, and—”</p>

<p>“Kill me?” said James, leaning toward her.
“You can slay me now with your killing glances
if you will. ’Deed, Miss Rhoda, I do love to
make you mad. You are always running down
Maryland, you know, and calling us fire-eaters,
and it just does me good to make the sparks fly.
Look around here—please look.”</p>

<p>But Rhoda persistently kept her head turned
away, perhaps to hide the tears of anger standing
in her eyes. She was not to be mollified by any
soft speeches.</p>

<p>“What are you up to, James?” called his aunt.
“How you do love to tease. I don’t think you will
give Rhoda a very good idea of Southern gallantry.”</p>

<p>James looked properly repentant. “’Deed, Miss
Rhoda,” he said softly, “I’m sorry, I’m dreadfully
sorry. You’re not crying?” in troubled surprise.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” snapped Rhoda. And, getting
up, she passed him swiftly, with head up, to enter
the house.</p>

<p>“Sho!” exclaimed James, looking after her,
“I’ve been and gone and done it this time, Aunt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>Martha. She’ll never forgive me, will she?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know; she oughtn’t to,”
returned Mrs. Hopkins. “You have no right to
berate her native state in that way; it is very rude,
to say the least.”</p>

<p>“So it is, for a fact. It’s right-down mean of
me. I’ll have to find some way to make up for it.”</p>

<p>And find a way he did. First his special messenger,
black Bounce, came over that afternoon
with a basket of the finest peaches that Rhoda
had ever seen, and next Lettice was seen galloping
up the lane on her bay mare. She stopped
in front of the porch where Rhoda sat sedately
sewing. “Rhoda, Rhoda,” cried she, “put down
your work; we are going fishing, and will take
supper with us, and Mr. Sam Osborne is going to
let us have a dance in his new barn this evening.”</p>

<p>Rhoda made no response, but sewed quietly on.</p>

<p>Lettice slipped down from her horse, and, still
holding the bridle, tapped on the step with her
whip. “Don’t you hear, you sober sides?” she
cried. “We’re going fishing, and we’re going to
Mr. Sam Osborne’s new barn for a dance. Old
Hank is going to bring his fiddle. How I do love
to dance! I assure you there are few things I
like better. Hurry up and get ready.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“‘I?’ Of course you. Jamie will be here in
a minute for you. He begged me to offer his
excuses for sending so sudden an invitation—we
only had the message from Mr. Osborne a few
minutes ago—and Jamie asks that he may be
your escort.”</p>

<p>“No, he may not,” Rhoda answered in a very
dignified tone.</p>

<p>“And why, pray?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t choose to give him the opportunity
to abuse my state and to mock me.”</p>

<p>“Did he do that? He didn’t mean it; he was
only teasing. Law me, Rhoda, he’s teased me
nearly to death ever since I was born. There
never was such a tease, nor such a dear boy, so all
the girls say. No one can stay angry with him
very long. He would be distressed to death if he
thought he had really hurt your feelings. I never
can stay angry with him.”</p>

<p>“I can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ll ride back and tell him. Becky
Lowe will be glad enough that you are not going.
I will stop by for Becky, and we can all go together.”</p>

<p>She again mounted her horse, calling back as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>she rode off: “Better change your mind. You’ll
miss a lot of fun.” At the gate which a little
darkey scrambled to open for her, she stopped and
called again, “Rhoda, Rhoda, come to the steps.”
Rhoda hesitated, but came slowly forward. “Somebody
said she’d bet a sixpence that you wouldn’t
go with James,” Lettice said.</p>

<p>“Who was it?”</p>

<p>“Becky Lowe.” And Lettice rode off, leaving
Rhoda half angry, and wholly uncertain as to
whether she did not regret her decided refusal.</p>

<p>Within the next half-hour she was sure that she
did regret it. There was something very fascinating
in this pleasure-seeking life of these care-free
Marylanders, who gave little thought for the morrow,
and gathered their delights without any compunctions,
and never questioned whether, for the
sake of practising self-denial, it was a duty to stay
at home from any entertainment which might offer.
“No one will care whether I stay or not,” Rhoda
told herself. “They will call me stiff and unsociable,
and will be glad they are rid of me, perhaps;
but—I needn’t have had much to say to James
if I had gone, and indeed, I might have found a
way to punish him.” She sighed, and sat with
rather a melancholy expression, looking out upon
the sparkling blue waters of the bay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Her revery was broken in upon by a voice saying
cheerily, “Hurry up, Miss Rhoda, I’m afraid
I’m late, but I had to go around by the mill.”</p>

<p>Rhoda arose. “Didn’t Lettice tell you?” she
asked in some confusion.</p>

<p>“That you didn’t mean to go? Yes, but I knew
you wouldn’t be so hard-hearted as to cheat me
out of an evening’s pleasure, not but that it would
be a very great pleasure to stay here with you.”</p>

<p>“Why, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“If you don’t go, I shan’t, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Rhoda looked at him, to see determination
written on every feature, but withal a most
tenderly pleading look in his eyes. “I’ll go,” she
said faintly.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>The Barn Frolic.</i></p>


<p>If Rhoda doubted James’s chivalric attitude
toward her, she had reason to change her mind
before the day was over. Her escort was all attention,
and when it became evident that Becky Lowe
had lost her wager, Lettice cast a merry glance at
Rhoda, giving her a nod of approval. In spite of the
fact that Becky was a neighbor, Lettice felt that she
must champion her uncle’s guest. As they stepped
aboard the little vessel which was to take them on
their short sail, she whispered to Patsey, “We must
make Rhoda have a good time.” And Patsey gave a
responsive smile.</p>

<p>Patsey had been a little jealous of Rhoda on Joe’s
account, but the evident devotion of his Cousin James
rather relieved her feelings in that direction, and she
confessed to herself that Joe had paid Rhoda only
such attentions as were becoming that he should
show to a visitor in his father’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Now what are we going to do?” asked Becky,
when they were all safely aboard the graceful sailboat
which, with canvas set, was speeding toward
Love Point.</p>

<p>“We’re going to Kent Island, you know,” Lettice
told her. “We are not going anywhere else first, are
we, Birket?” She turned to address a very young
gentleman at her side.</p>

<p>“No, miss,” he returned, “so Joe Hopkins says.
I was over at the Ringgold’s, and Joe asked me to
come along.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t come without knowing where we
were going, did you, Birket?”</p>

<p>The young man murmured something unintelligible,
and gave his attention to the jib-boom which
threatened to annihilate Rhoda, who was not used to
a sailing vessel.</p>

<p>“You don’t go sailing up your way much, do you,
Miss Kendall?” Becky said. “We all down here go
about on the water as much as we do on the land.”</p>

<p>“We don’t have to,” Rhoda returned, a trifle
defiantly. She was on the defensive since her late
talk with James. She had scarcely spoken to the
young man since they had started from home, but
had managed to seat herself near Patsey and Joe.</p>

<p>“No, they don’t have to up there,” spoke up James.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>“They have good roads, and go straight at a thing
instead of driving over roundabout ways for miles to
a place not a mile off, as we have to do. I tell you
that is a fine harbor they have there at Boston, Miss
Rhoda! Ever been there, Becky?”</p>

<p>“No, you know I haven’t!” she returned with
some vexation.</p>

<p>“And it’s a beautiful coast,” James went on;
“rocky, you know; not sandy like ours. It certainly
seems right pretty after our level country, where we
go miles on a stretch without so much as one little
hill to break the monotony.”</p>

<p>Becky was silenced for the time, but she had shafts
in reserve. She resented the presence of this fair-haired
Northern girl. What business had she down
there usurping Becky’s own right to an admirer?
Lettice watched the manœuvres of Miss Becky with
sly glances at Patsey. Lettice herself was entirely
heart-free. She was too young to be greatly troubled
by affairs of sentiment, although she had twice
imagined herself violently in love; once with a young
gentleman who had passed an evening at her uncle’s,
and who had made himself particularly agreeable to
her; even now she liked to think about him, wondering
if she should ever see him again. He was from
New York, she remembered, and she became so
absorbed in her recollections of him, that she did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
notice the youthful cavalier who stood waiting to help
her ashore.</p>

<p>“Lettice is going to stay where she is,”
laughed Becky; “she doesn’t care to dance, you
know, nor does she care for supper.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I?” cried Lettice, on her feet at once.
“I do care. Your hand, Birk, and I’ll be ashore
before any one;” which indeed she was, and stood
laughing to greet the others as each made the
landing.</p>

<p>A supper of oysters, crabs, biscuits, and such-like
Maryland dainties, was eaten merrily enough.
Rhoda was a little reserved, but chatted pleasantly
with Patsey, Joe, and the one or two whom she
knew; Lettice was full of fun, and was as sportive
as a kitten, ready to go crabbing, or to row
out into the creek whose waters reflected a gorgeous
sunset sky, to tease her Cousin Joe, or her
Brother James, till finally she dropped down on
the sands in quite a thoughtful mood, listening to
Becky’s lazy voice as she inquired of Rhoda,
“Do you go fox-hunting, Miss Kendall?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” was the reply. “I ride sometimes,
but we are not much given to the chase.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Becky lifted her eyebrows. “It’s very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>exciting, and we all think it’s great fun. Shall
you stay long enough to go this fall when the
season begins?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know; it will depend upon my
father’s plans. He is in Washington now.”</p>

<p>“Is he getting ready to fight?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” Rhoda returned severely.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t you want war? We all do; we
think it must come. Isn’t it funny, Mr. Dean?
Miss Kendall doesn’t approve of the war.”</p>

<p>“That’s because she’s from Massachusetts,” Mr.
Dean made reply, having reasons of his own for
wanting to please Miss Becky.</p>

<p>Rhoda bit her lip, but James came to the rescue.
“Look here,” he said; “it seems to me
that it’s pretty early to be flinging at Massachusetts.
The war’s hardly begun, and if she wants
to be cautious, what’s that to us? I think
her Revolutionary record will stand investigation.
We know well enough how she gave everything
to the cause; her men didn’t spare themselves,
neither did her women. I say it’s too early,
Dean, to criticise.” He had moved closer to
Rhoda, and she looked up at him gratefully.
“Perhaps we are the ones who are wrong, after
all,” James continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Stephen Dean gave a low whistle. “Whew!”
he exclaimed, “I thought you were hot foot for
war.”</p>

<p>“So I am; but that isn’t saying that I’m infallible,
is it? If we get whipped, maybe we’ll wish
we hadn’t been quite so peart in stirring up old
England—Hallo! there’s a boat coming in. It’s
your father, Miss Rhoda, and Uncle Tom, and a
stranger.”</p>

<p>The small vessel containing the new arrivals
now gracefully approached the landing, and in a
moment Rhoda was welcoming her father, Joe
was rapidly putting questions, while before Lettice,
who was standing shyly apart, was bowing
the young gentleman of her dreams. “Fair Miss
Lettice, this is a very happy meeting,” said young
Mr. Robert Clinton. “I am fortunate to have
arrived in time for a jubilee. What is the occasion?
a birthday?”</p>

<p>“No special occasion; it is but one of the
frolics we often have. Mr. Sam Osborne has
built a new barn, and the young people in the
neighborhood are going to have a dance there this
evening. We have just been having a crab supper.”</p>

<p>“Am I too late for scraps?”</p>

<p>“No, there is an abundance left. I will order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>Bounce to get you all something.”</p>

<p>“Don’t run away.”</p>

<p>“I will come back. I must see if my father
sent me a message.” She approached her Uncle
Tom, having stopped to bid Bounce serve the
gentlemen with the best that was left of the
feast.</p>

<p>“Free trade and sailor’s rights! that is the
cry,” her uncle was saying, and on the other side,
Mr. Kendall replied, “As our great Josiah
Quincy says, sir, ‘we’re not going to be kicked
into a war.’ Sailor’s rights, indeed! Where is
your navy?”</p>

<p>“There,” Mr. Hopkins waved his hand toward
the blue Chesapeake dotted with the white sails
of her schooners and clippers.</p>

<p>Mr. Kendall smiled sarcastically. “And your
marines?”</p>

<p>“Here,” returned Mr. Hopkins, indicating the
party of sunburnt young men before them.
“Think you, sir, that we shall endure the heel of
England upon our necks? You may be willing
meekly to accept her abuse for the sake of the
profit that will accrue from swallowing her insults,
but we of the South are of a different mould.”</p>

<p>“Your John Randolph is not so eager to voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>your cry of free trade and sailor’s rights.”</p>

<p>“But our Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun do
voice it.”</p>

<p>“Politics! Politics!” cried Lettice. “Just a
short rest from them, Uncle Tom. Will you and
Mr. Kendall partake of some refreshments, and
leave politics till another time? It seems to me
that you will find it vastly more agreeable to discuss
a devilled crab. Uncle Tom, did you bring
me any message from my father?”</p>

<p>“His love, and he will see you before we are
ordered off.”</p>

<p>“Ordered off! Oh, Uncle Tom, you are really
going to join the troops?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is the news from Canada, father?”
Rhoda asked.</p>

<p>“What might have been expected,” he returned;
“Hull has surrendered.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you mean General William Hull?”</p>

<p>“That’s the man.”</p>

<p>Rhoda cast a triumphant glance at James who had
joined them, and the lad flushed angrily. “Is that
really true, or is it only a report?” he asked his uncle.</p>

<p>“Too true,” he answered; “but,” laying his hand
on the boy’s shoulder, “we shall have need of you
yet, Jamie. We are disgusted, but not defeated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
for another Hull has given us a glorious victory
on the sea to offset our defeat on land.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, sir? We haven’t heard the news
yet.”</p>

<p>“You might have heard it fast enough, if you
had been a little nearer to Baltimore, for they
fired salutes in honor of the news, and every ship
in the harbor ran up her flag. Captain Isaac
Hull has taken the <i>Guerrière</i> as a prize into
Boston, and the whole country is jubilant.”</p>

<p>“The <i>Guerrière</i>? Dacres’s ship? Then Hull
has won his hat,” James cried. “Hurrah for Hull
and the old <i>Constitution</i>!”</p>

<p>“What’s that about a hat?” Lettice asked.</p>

<p>“Why, Dacres and Hull laid a wager of a hat,
each declaring that he would whip the other if
they ever met on the high seas, and old Hull has
won.” And James struck up a song written by
Mr. Francis Hopkinson and called “The Favorite
New Federal Song,” although we know it now as
“Hail Columbia.”</p>

<p>“And you, sir?” said Lettice to Mr. Clinton,
who, with a devilled crab in one hand and a sandwich
in the other, was about to throw himself at
her feet. “You, Mr. Clinton, what do you think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>of this war question?”</p>

<p>“It’s all nonsense!” he exclaimed with an amused
glance at her. “Surely, Miss Lettice, a pretty girl
doesn’t need to bother her head about loans, taxes,
navies, and war news.”</p>

<p>Lettice regarded him gravely. “I am not so
sure about that,” she rejoined. “I don’t really
know all about it, but I don’t think the British
have any right to steal our sailors.”</p>

<p>“And what do you think of the letters-of-marque
and reprisal? And will you favor me with
your opinion on carrying trade and the constructive
blockade?”</p>

<p>Lettice looked bewildered, and Mr. Clinton
laughed. “I did but tease you, fair demoiselle.
’Tis not for ladies to bother their heads about
such things; what concerns them more is a
question of a becoming gown or a new dancing
step. What, by the way, is this that I hear of
a dance in a barn? May I hope to have the
honor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like.”</p>

<p>“The first?”</p>

<p>“That is promised,” returned Lettice, reluctantly.</p>

<p>“The second, then?”</p>

<p>“That, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“The third, then?”</p>

<p>“I told my Cousin Joe that I would give him
that, but—”</p>

<p>“Since he is your cousin, perhaps I can persuade
him to exchange places with me, if you will
allow.”</p>

<p>“Oh! ye-es,” Lettice replied, trying to cover
her first exclamation of eagerness by a little show
of reluctance. “If you like, you can settle it with
Cousin Joe. I don’t care.”</p>

<p>Her uncle was watching her amusedly. “Don’t
go over to the enemy, Letty,” he said as she passed
him.</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” she replied, laughing, but with
a little fluttering at heart. What was the use of
a girl’s bothering about politics, after all, she
thought; even James had said that perhaps a war
was not right, and—yes, of course she was what
her father was, but that didn’t mean she could not
have friends on the other side. Look at Mr.
Kendall and her Uncle Tom, they were brothers-in-law
and friends, yet they didn’t agree. So she
put all disturbing questions aside, and danced her
prettiest with this new gallant, feeling that she
was the envy of the older girls, for no one was led
out more gracefully than she, though all the neighborhood
was famous for its good dancers. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
tobacco barn with its big floor was a fine place for
a dance, and the courtseyings and dippings and
bowings went on till all hours. The fashion of
round dances had not yet reached the place, and
more stately measures were used.</p>

<p>“Across there, where you see the lights twinkling,
is Annapolis,” Lettice told Mr. Clinton on
their homeward voyage. She had turned a cold
shoulder on Birket Dean, and was listening with
evident pleasure to the newcomer’s low-spoken
words. “It was from there the <i>Constitution</i> sailed,
only last month; we saw her go out. I wonder
what will be the next news,” she said in one of the
pauses of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Still troubling your pretty head with such
matters?” returned Mr. Clinton, smiling at her.
“Rather let us speak of yonder moon sailing so
serenely across the heavens.” And he began to
quote poetry to her, till she did indeed forget war’s
alarms.</p>

<p>Lounging at Rhoda’s feet, James every now and
then turned his curly head toward the slim girl
figure. She was very kind to him on this homeward
trip, and they did not once get into an argument.</p>

<p>Joe and Patsey sat suspiciously close together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
They were both very quiet. “If I were going to
be married at Christmas, I wonder if I should find
no more to talk about than Joe and Patsey,”
Lettice thought. But she did not know that the
wedding day was an indefinite matter, and that
Joe had just informed his sweetheart that he
should, in a few days, take command of one of
his father’s clippers, and that his business would
be to harass English vessels whenever he could.
“I’d like to meet that wretched thief who stole
Pat Flynn,” he said; “I’d make him suffer for it.”
But Patsey was silent. Privateering for her Joe!
The uncertainty of the sea was bad enough, but
add to that the dangers of warfare, and it was too
much. The girl’s heart was very full; she could
only let her hand lie in Joe’s strong clasp, and be
thankful for the present, for the future seemed
suddenly to slip into an impenetrable cloud.</p>

<p>At first Joe had urged an immediate marriage,
but Patsey shook her head. “You’ll be back by
Christmas?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Surely, unless—” His clasp on Patsey’s
hand tightened, and he had no further words.</p>

<p>The little craft rounded Love’s Point and turned
into the waters of the Chester River. “Your uncle
promises me some rare sport during the shooting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
season down here. The country is a very paradise,
not only because of its delights, but because of
the angelic beings who dwell here,” Mr. Clinton
remarked sentimentally to Lettice.</p>

<p>“Angels?” laughed Lettice. “Do you perhaps
mean ghosts? The darkies are dreadfully afraid
of them, and won’t go near our graveyard.”</p>

<p>“Have you a special graveyard of your own?”</p>

<p>“Yes, haven’t you? Ours is such a quiet, dim
little corner of the plantation. It is all moss-grown,
and the trees are so thick and green there.”</p>

<p>“Will you show it to me some day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like; but I don’t believe I’d care
to go there at night myself.”</p>

<p>“Not if I were with you? Surely, you’d not be
afraid then.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t keep off haunts,” returned Lettice.
“Don’t let’s talk of them, it makes me creepy. I
like the place in the daytime, when the sun shines
in between the leaves and flickers down on the
headstones. It is pleasant to go there then, and
lie in the long grass, only I always like to have
Lutie, even then.”</p>

<p>“And who is Lutie?”</p>

<p>“My maid. She belonged to my mother, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>was given to me when I was born.”</p>

<p>“And your mother?”</p>

<p>“She lies in the graveyard; so does my little
sister. My eldest brother’s headstone is there,
too.” Lettice gave a sigh; she always did when
she spoke of this brother; a wild young fellow who
had been a trial to his family, and who one day
set off for Norfolk with a set of roistering fellows,
as feather-brained as himself, and had fallen overboard.
A stone to his memory had been set up
in the family burying-ground, although his body
had never been recovered. This loss was the
shock which hastened his mother’s death, and the
family rarely spoke of him.</p>

<p>Just then the old darkey who had been playing
such tunes as “Cooney in de Holler” and “Jim
along o’ Josey” struck up a plaintive melody on
his fiddle. They were nearing home. Overhead a
waning moon was low in the heavens, athwart
which, now and then, sped a meteor; all was still,
save for the lapping of waves against the sides of
the boats or the sound of the light breeze in the
sails. One could not realize that soon from shore
to shore would reverberate the cannon’s booming,
and that terror would overspread the fair and
quiet land.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Some Coquetries.</i></p>


<p>While the long summer days lasted, Robert
Clinton remained a guest at Mr. Tom
Hopkins’s. It was a pet scheme of Rhoda’s father
that she should marry the young New Yorker, and
he trusted to his sister to further the scheme; yet,
as is so often the case, neither of the two most
concerned seemed to evince any great heartiness
in the matter. Rhoda, as was proper, received
from Mr. Clinton such attentions as he was bound
to pay to the niece of his hostess, but there was
scarcely a day that did not see him riding down
the road toward the neighboring plantation of Mr.
William Hopkins, with the excuse to Mr. Kendall
that Will Hopkins had promised him a young
hound, and he wanted to look after the training
of the animal, or he and James were going crabbing
or sailing.</p>

<p>On one of the days in the latter part of the
summer, Lettice was sitting on a sunken gray slab
in the old graveyard, with Lutie lying at her feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
in the tall grass. Lettice was soberly setting neat
stitches in a delicate bit of cambric. There were
many things on her mind, and she had fled to this
quiet spot for reflection. She was silent so long
that at last Lutie raised a timid voice, “Huccome
yuh so qui’t, Miss Letty?”</p>

<p>“Because I want to think,” returned Lettice.</p>

<p>Lutie raised herself on her elbow and peeped
through the thicket of green; just beyond in the
garden old Unc’ Eph’am was pottering about, watering
the flowers, which he did, rain or shine. It
was his only duty; and since the old man was fast
losing his wits, but still retained his habits, he
never failed to give the flowers their daily watering,
whether they needed it or not. “Dey a
gemp’an comin’ up de lane, Miss Letty,” drawled
Lutie.</p>

<p>“Is there?” A faint little blush tinged Lettice’s
cheek.</p>

<p>“Yass, miss. He dat dan’ified Mars Clinton, dat
ain’t nuvver rid behin’ de houn’s, Jubal say.”</p>

<p>“Jubal is a goose.”</p>

<p>“Is yuh gwine to de house, Miss Letty? Shall
I fetch yo book and yo wuck-bag?”</p>

<p>A smile flickered around Lettice’s lips. “No,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>she answered, “I am going to stay here.”</p>

<p>Lutie sighed, and sank back again in the grass;
she didn’t “y’arn fo’ de grabeyard” at any time,
and hoped for an excuse which would set her free
to go elsewhere. Lettice looked at her with an
amused expression. “I believe you are scared
to stay here, even in the daytime, Lutie,” she
remarked.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, Miss Letty, I ain’t ’zactly skeert,
but I feels kin o’ creepy when I sees yuh a-settin’
on yo gre’t gran’daddy grabe.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why.”</p>

<p>“Kase he de one dat ha’nt de place,” replied
Lutie, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! I don’t believe it at all.”</p>

<p>“Yass, miss, he do so; he go on tur’ble, Jubal
say, uvver since Mars Torm go ’way.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Lutie,” said Lettice, peremptorily. “I
don’t like such talk.”</p>

<p>Lutie looked properly abashed and sought to
change the subject. “Is yuh skeert o’ Poly Bonypart,
Miss Letty?”</p>

<p>“No; why should I be?”</p>

<p>“’Cause he a—a—. He mos’ wuss an’ anybody.
He got gre’t big eyes, an’ he tall as a tree, an’
he cuts off folkses haids if dey dar’s look at him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>an’ he go rampagin’ roun’ an’ kills folks fo’ fun.
Yuh reckon he uvver come dis way, Miss Letty?
When Jubal tell me ’bout him, I so skeert I pulls
up de kivers when I goes to baid, an’ I keeps mah
haid un’er dem, an’ I jes’ shivers an’ shakes.”</p>

<p>“And let your feet stick out where he can
see them; that’s what you always do,” Lettice
observed.</p>

<p>“Law, Miss Letty!” Lutie sat up in alarm.
“Yuh talks lak you ’spected him.”</p>

<p>Lettice’s peal of laughter discovered her whereabouts
to a rather annoyed young man who had
been sauntering up and down the porch while
a couple of small negroes scudded upstairs and
down in a vain search for the young lady, and
before Lettice was aware of his presence, Robert
Clinton looked over the hedge, exclaiming triumphantly:
“Ah, here you are; and this is the
graveyard that you would never show me. I
might have known that you would be in hiding
here.”</p>

<p>“I’m not in hiding,” Lettice replied, rising to
her feet. “It is one of my favorite retreats, as I
told you; and if you had paid the heed to my
words that you pretend, you would have remembered.”</p>

<p>The young man looked rather disconcerted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
“But, you know, you have always refused to come
here with me, and how was I to know the way?”</p>

<p>“You could have asked.”</p>

<p>“May I come in now?” he inquired humbly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think my father would object,” Lettice
returned demurely, and the young man vaulted the
hedge instantly. “You should have gone around;
at the other side there is an opening,” Lettice
told him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it. This is an interesting spot,
isn’t it?” he said, throwing himself down by her
side. “What fair, sweet flowers grow here; but
the fairest of all—”</p>

<p>“Lutie,” cried Lettice, “there’s that old turkey-hen
now. I saw her run out from behind Theophilus
Hopkins’s grave. Go head her off. Excuse
me, Mr. Clinton, you were saying something about
flowers.”</p>

<p>“I was saying,” he returned, a little put out,
“that you have planted some very pretty flowers
in here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; we like to keep the place as pretty
as we can. Come, we will go over there on the
other side of the hedge by that big tree. I have
been in here long enough. Was it warm riding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>over?”</p>

<p>“Yes, more than warm, hot; but there’s a
refreshing breeze from the creek just here; I’d
like to take you out there.”</p>

<p>Lettice looked at him with a twinkle in her eye.
“You mean you would like me to take you out
there. You can’t sail a boat.”</p>

<p>“I can row.”</p>

<p>“On this hot afternoon? No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Am I never to see you alone for as much as
half an hour?”</p>

<p>“Why should you?”</p>

<p>“Because I—Do you know what keeps me down
here?”</p>

<p>“Politics, I suppose,” returned Lettice, suavely.
“I suppose you are waiting to hear what Mr. Kendall
will report when he next comes from Washington,
and if it is news to your liking, you will start home,
and Rhoda—By the way, how is Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“She is well. I left her with your brother on the
porch.”</p>

<p>“Jamie is a dear lad. So that is why you came
over, because your devoirs to Miss Rhoda were
interrupted by my brother?”</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Lettice, you know my firmament contains
but one ruling star, and that is—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Not there, Lutie,” Lettice cried. “I’ll come
and help you, or she’ll get away. Excuse me, Mr.
Clinton, but I must help Lutie with that turkey-hen;
she is so wild, and has a brood in the bushes. If she
once gets off in the woods, there’ll be no catching
her again,” and off she started. Then, after many
flappings of her sunbonnet to shoo the turkey-hen,
and many beatings about the blackberry bushes, the
creature was headed off, and Lutie was bidden to call
Anstice Ann to come and help to drive her up.
Then Lettice returned to her visitor. “You were
saying something about stars, weren’t you, or was it
meteors? Are you versed in astronomy? What is
our evening star just now?”</p>

<p>“I know but one, and that is a lode-star which is
both morning and evening star to me.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! you’re like those children of Israel,
aren’t you? Oh, no, I mean—What do I mean?
Did you ever go to camp-meeting?”</p>

<p>“No, I never had that experience.”</p>

<p>“Then you must go; your education has been
sadly neglected, for you don’t know about lots of
the things that we do. We always go over to Wye
Camp.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall not be here when it begins.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shall you not? I thought you were to stay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>to learn to ride after the hounds.”</p>

<p>“Learn to ride! Do you suppose I never mounted
a horse?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; but you’ve never been fox-hunting.
I expect you will enjoy it.”</p>

<p>“If the fox is as elusive as—”</p>

<p>“As what?” Lettice looked up saucily.</p>

<p>The young man caught her hand. “You know
who eludes me and defies me and makes miserable
my days and nights, and makes me advance and
retreat till I am driven to distraction.”</p>

<p>“No, does she? What a wicked girl Rhoda is.
I never dreamed she could be so cruel. Thank you,
I do not need your hand to assist me to rise.”</p>

<p>“You will not leave me yet? Just one moment
more. I have not spoken to you alone for so long,
and you are so good to give me this opportunity.”</p>

<p>“I give it? What do you mean, sir?” Lettice’s
blue eyes grew dark with disapproval.</p>

<p>“You sent off your maid, you know,” he murmured
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“That you might speak to me alone? You are
mistaken, sir; it was all on account of the turkey-hen;
I had forgotten your existence.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I will try to; but I am sorry I cannot listen
to your confidences about Rhoda. I forgot entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
that I promised Sister Betty that I would see to
the syllabub.”</p>

<p>“You know it isn’t Rhoda,” persisted the young
man.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it? Well, never mind; it is Becky
Lowe, probably. She told me you were there last
week. No, another time. You will excuse me, I
know, and I shall see you at tea time. There
comes Brother William, if your call was upon him.
He will be glad to see you. Adieu.” And Lettice,
with work-bag dangling from her wrist, and
Moore’s poems under her arm, ran swiftly up the
garden walk to the house. She held her sunbonnet
closely together, and her hands were
covered with long sheepskin mittens, lest the sun
should mar the whiteness of her skin. Her sister
Betty met her by the grape arbor; she was
similarly protected, and had a light basket on
her arm.</p>

<p>“Law, Lettice, what makes you run in the sun?”
she said. “Why didn’t you come around the other
way?”</p>

<p>“I wanted the shortest way,” returned Lettice,
panting a little, and letting go the strings of her
bonnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>Betty looked at her quizzically. “I don’t believe
I ever ran from a young gentleman in my life,”
she said, laughing. “You ought to be ashamed
to be such a scare-cat, Letty.” Then she seized
the sides of the girl’s bonnet and looked fixedly
at her. “Lettice Hopkins, are you going ’way
off to New York with that Tory? Do you mean
to separate yourself from your family and become
an English subject?”</p>

<p>“’Deed I’m not, Sister Betty.”</p>

<p>“Then go ’long into the house, and don’t make
yourself look too bewitching at supper. I finished
the syllabub myself. There comes Birk Dean.
After all, perhaps you’d better not put on your
least becoming frock.” And Lettice ran up to her
room, pouting.</p>

<p>It was not long before Lutie followed, and, after
much indecision and the turning over of many
gowns, Lettice was finally arrayed in a blue tissue,
made with a very short waist and a skimp skirt,
and around her shoulders was thrown a scarf of
India muslin. She descended the stairs demurely,
and walked out upon the porch, where her two
admirers sat looking daggers at each other.</p>

<p>“Since I leave the neighborhood to-morrow, perhaps
you will honor me with your company for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>walk,” said Mr. Clinton.</p>

<p>Lettice gave a quick side glance at Birket. “I
came over to see if you’d ride to camp this evening,
Miss Lettice,” said Birket, blushing to the
roots of his hair.</p>

<p>“Has camp begun?” Lettice asked; then with
a little laugh, “I can’t walk and ride both, can
I?” She turned her smiling face to first one
and then the other. “I will tell you what we
will do: we’ll get Brother William to let us have
the big wagon and the mules, and all go over
in a party; that will be much the best way.
Supper is ready, gentlemen. Mr. Clinton, will
you escort Sister Betty? She is just here waiting
for you to give her your hand.” And in
the pretty old-fashioned way they were led out to
supper.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clinton leaves us, Brother William. Did
you say to-morrow?” said Lettice, turning to the
young man.</p>

<p>“I am going up with Mr. Kendall to Washington,”
he answered, without a smile.</p>

<p>“He will miss the fox-hunting, won’t he, Brother
William? I thought that was what you came down
here for.” She turned again to Mr. Clinton.</p>

<p>“Washington isn’t so far away but that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>can come back again,” said William. “That’s what
you intend to do, of course.” He turned to his
guest.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he replied, giving a meaning glance
at Lettice, who hastened to say lightly, “Then
it is not a long farewell.” And she turned her
attention to young Birket Dean, who was mightily
complacent in consequence.</p>

<p>During the entire evening Lettice chose to
ignore Mr. Clinton, whom she relegated to a
place by Rhoda’s side when the big wagon-load
of young folks started to camp-meeting. It was
no new experience to any of them except to
Rhoda and to Robert Clinton, who viewed the
proceedings with interest and with some wonder;
they were not used to seeing such exhibitions
of religious excitement at their own homes.
But instead of camp-meeting hymns, on their
way back, the young people started up such war-songs
as:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Too long our tars have borne in peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With British domineering;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But now they’ve shown that trade should cease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For vengeance they are steering.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First gallant Hull, he was the lad</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who sailed a tyrant hunting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And swaggering Dacres soon was glad</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To strike to striped bunting.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>
<p>“Why don’t you sing?” Lettice asked Mr.
Clinton, with fun in her eyes. “Rhoda says you
have a right pretty voice. And you, Rhoda, are
silent, too. What is the matter? One would
suppose the same complaint had seized the two
of you and given you husky throats.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I know Dacres,” Mr. Clinton began.</p>

<p>“He knows Dacres! Think of it, girls!” said
Lettice, bent on teasing. “How proud he must
be of the acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“I am proud. He is a gallant, brave fellow,”
returned Mr. Clinton, in some heat.</p>

<p>“But that didn’t save him from getting whipped,”
Lettice chanted in glee. “Let us make our manners,
ladies and gentlemen, to a friend of Lieutenant
Dacres, who is a friend of England, consequently
no friend of ours.”</p>

<p>“Now, Lettice,” Rhoda interposed, “don’t stir
every one up.”</p>

<p>“You called for a song,” cried Robert Clinton,
springing to his feet. “We will give you one.
Join in, Miss Rhoda.” And he began:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Huzza for our liberty, boys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These are the days of our glory;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The days of true national joys,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When terrapins gallop before ye.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s Porter and Grundy and Rhea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In Congress, who manfully vapor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who draw their six dollars a day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And fight bloody battles on paper.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, this is true Terrapin war.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But before they had proceeded very far with their
song, every lad in the wagon was on his feet, and
the Terrapin war was drowned out by the lusty
singing of:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Firm as our native hills we stand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And should the lords of Europe land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll meet them on the furthest strand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll conquer, or we’ll die!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the discord of the two different songs striking
the quiet of the night, as they passed the
farm-houses along the way, brought more than one
person to the gate to see what was this noisy
crowd.</p>

<p>Hospitable, polite, and ready as they were to offer
their best to a guest, the young men of the party
showed some coolness to Robert Clinton when they
made their adieux; but Lettice, with a pricking of
conscience at having brought about the condition
of affairs which led to the situation, felt sorry for
the young man, and, leaning down from the wagon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>as it stopped at her Uncle Tom’s gate, she said in
a soft whisper, “You’ll be over to-morrow to say
good-by, won’t you?”</p>

<p>The young man, with a sudden lifting of the
gloom on his face, whispered back eagerly, “May
I come?” But the noise of the wagon as it rumbled
off drowned Lettice’s answer, if she made any.</p>

<p>By the time the summer was over, many of
Lettice’s friends had left the neighborhood.
Rhoda had gone to Washington to join her father,
who was still detained in the capital city. Mr.
Clinton, too, was there. In October both Mr. Tom
Hopkins and Lettice’s father marched away to the
Canada border, and among the armed vessels which
Baltimore sent out to annoy the enemy was one
commanded by Joe Hopkins; this had started down
the Chesapeake in August, and Patsey was wistfully
looking for news from her absent lover. Betty’s
pleadings had kept her husband at home, so far; and
Jamie, although he threatened each day to follow
his father, still lingered.</p>

<p>“You’d better stay at home and protect us,”
Betty and Lettice would say. “Suppose the enemy
should come up the Chesapeake, where would we be?
And if I were left a young widow, William, think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>how sad,” Betty would say as a final argument.</p>

<p>“I think I will go to sea with Cousin Joe when
he comes back,” James at last concluded. “I tell
you we’re licking the British on the water, whatever
we may be doing on land. Commodore
Barney captured fifteen vessels in the forty-five
days he was running along the coast, and news
has come that the <i>Wasp</i> has captured the <i>Frolic</i>,
and the <i>United States</i> has the <i>Macedonian</i>, if last
reports are correct.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Lettice. “I wonder how Rhoda
likes that.”</p>

<p>James looked down, and with the toe of his boot
rolled over one of the hounds at his feet; then he
looked up, saying, “And Robert Clinton, how do
you suppose he takes it?”</p>

<p>Lettice gave her head a little toss. “What do I
care how he takes it! Is there news from Canada,
Brother William?”</p>

<p>“No good news. We must be content with our
victories at sea, for the present. Our little state
has nothing to be ashamed of in her naval exploits.”</p>

<p>Just then the smart rap of a whip-handle on the
door announced a visitor, and Birket Dean walked
in. “I was coming this way, Miss Lettice,” he
said, after greeting them all, “and I brought along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>this letter that came for you on one of the boats.”</p>

<p>“A letter?” Lettice eagerly held out her hand,
and tore open the letter fastened with seals, for as
yet envelopes were unknown. She gave her attention
to the closely written pages, then looked up,
and said animatedly: “Oh, brother! oh, Sister Betty,
Rhoda wants me to come to Washington for a
visit! I should so love to go to see the President
and Mrs. Madison, and oh, do say I may go!”</p>

<p>“Alone?” returned her brother William, smiling.
“You wouldn’t expect me to leave Betty and the
baby to take you, would you?”</p>

<p>“Jamie could take me. You would like nothing
better, would you, Jamie?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, yes; but—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind; I can go as far as Baltimore
with Aunt Martha, and she can find some one
in whose charge to place me. I will see Aunt
Martha this very evening.”</p>

<p>“Will you ride over with me?” Birket asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you will stay to supper. Here, Jamie, I
know you are dying to see this, and as there are no
secrets in it, you may as well have the pleasure of
perusing it.” And Lettice tossed her letter to her
brother James.</p>

<p>It was a lovely ride down the road in the hush of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
an October evening; the landscape, taking on an
autumnal hue, showed a soft envelopment of purple
mist. To the right lay the blue bay, across which
dimly appeared the spires of the little town of
Annapolis.</p>

<p>“It is truly a beautiful scene,” said Lettice, gazing
around her. She looked like a bit of autumn herself
in her scarlet jacket, and with the shining wing
of a swamp blackbird in her hat. She had, it is
true, some compunctions in accepting the wing,
being of a most tender heart. Birket had given it to
her, and quieted her protests by telling her how the
thieving birds had stolen the corn and must be shot,
if the crops must be protected. “Better that than
to have them caught by a prowling beast, for we
shoot them and they die instantly, otherwise who
knows but that they may suffer tortures.”</p>

<p>Lettice had stroked the bright feathers thoughtfully,
saying, “Since he is dead, I may as well wear
his feathers, but bring me no more, Birk; it makes
me sad to see them.”</p>

<p>“And how about the foxes?” Birket had said.</p>

<p>“Ah, the foxes, they are thieves, too; but I always
shut my eyes when the hounds pounce on them.
’Tis a pity the world is not big enough for us and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>them, too.”</p>

<p>The conversation had taken place a day or two
before, for Birket was a frequent visitor. His
father’s plantation lay on the other side of Mr. William
Hopkins’s, but on account of the wrigglings in
and out of a little creek, it was easier reached by
water than by land.</p>

<p>“It is a truly lovely scene,” Lettice repeated.</p>

<p>“And yet you want to leave it,” Birket returned
reproachfully.</p>

<p>“So I do, for I love new scenes, and Rhoda says
there are many gay doings at the capital.”</p>

<p>“It is not much of a place,” Birket remarked;
“not near so fine as Baltimore.”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. Baltimore is the third city in
the Union. Nevertheless, seeing that I have been to
Baltimore and have never been to Washington, I
shall like to go to the least familiar place.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Clinton is there?” Birket asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Lettice gave her horse a gentle flick with her
whip. “I don’t know,” she said shortly, as the
horse changed his walk to a canter.</p>

<p>A few weeks later saw the two girls, Lettice and
Rhoda, together in Washington, Aunt Martha having
readily found an escort for Lettice in the person of
one Mr. Francis Key, whose affability and courtesy
lessened the tedium of the long trip, for it was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
day’s journey by coach from Baltimore to Washington.</p>

<p>Dark though it was when Lettice arrived, she
could perceive that Washington had little pretensions
to being a fine place. After leaving the busy
city of Baltimore, with its forty thousand inhabitants,
its streets bright with lamps and full of the noise of
rushing feet, of singing sailors, and rumbling carts,
Washington, where scarce more than five thousand
persons dwelt, seemed little more than a village, full
of mud-holes, and showing a small number of houses
at scattered distances. Lettice, however, was not to
stay in Washington, for after the coach had rattled
over the newly laid pike, and she had dimly discerned
the white walls of the unfinished Capitol, she
was helped down from her seat and entered a hackney
coach, which was driven up and down hill, over
Rock Creek, through mud and mire, until it arrived
in Georgetown, a more habitable place than that
which they had just left. Comfortable, spacious
houses stood to the right and left of them—houses
which to-day, dingy and dilapidated, give small evidence
of having witnessed the brilliant scenes once
of frequent occurrence within their walls.</p>

<p>Lettice was welcomed with more heartiness than
she had expected from the reserved Rhoda, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
parted with her kind escort, after many thanks for
his thoughtful attentions.</p>

<p>“You must be sadly weary, Lettice,” said Rhoda,
as she led her friend upstairs to a room overlooking
the blue Potomac. “I well remember how
fatigued I was when I arrived; but I hope you will
soon get over your journey’s effects, for there are
to be fine doings here next week, and you must be
in your best trim. Did you bring your prettiest
gowns?”</p>

<p>“I did, indeed, and a new one is to be sent as soon
as the mantua-maker has it finished. Are you having
a good time here, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“Fairly pleasant, though the wretched war stirs
up all sorts of ill feeling, and one never knows what
will happen, or what unpleasant things one may
hear; yet I have much less to stand than the President’s
wife, and should not complain.”</p>

<p>“The President’s wife, Mrs. Dolly Madison? Is
any one so churlish as to show ill-will toward her?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes. She is sometimes treated with
much discourtesy, because they impute all the woes
of the country to her husband.”</p>

<p>“As if she could help that! What gumps some
people be! And have you seen Mrs. Madison,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>Rhoda? Do you know her?”</p>

<p>“I have met her several times, and she is a charming
lady.”</p>

<p>“And your beaux, Rhoda? What of them?”
The two girls looked at each other, and both blushed
faintly; then Lettice, summoning up courage, asked,
“Are you promised to Mr. Clinton, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked down and answered faintly, “Not
yet.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave her head a little toss, and a haughty
look came into her dark blue eyes. “You mean
that you could be if you wanted?”</p>

<p>“My father wishes it very much.” Rhoda’s eyes
were still downcast.</p>

<p>“Your father? And how about you and the
gentleman himself?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t?” There was some consolation
in this, Lettice thought, and she determined to watch
for herself.</p>

<p>The capital, raw and incomplete as it looked, still
furnished more gayeties than Lettice found at home.
Here were gathered the statesmen of the day, and
the girl was all eagerness to have this or that important
personage pointed out to her. Henry Clay
and John C. Calhoun, John Randolph of Roanoke, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>great friend of Lettice’s late travelling companion,
Mr. Frank Key, and many other distinguished men
were to be seen in the city during the session of
Congress. The appearance of some of these rather
disappointed Lettice. She thought the President a
very insignificant person for so great an office, she
wrote home to James, and Mr. Randolph was the
oddest looking man she had ever seen.</p>

<p>“There is to be a great ball at Tomlinson’s hotel,”
was one of the first pieces of news that Rhoda gave
her friend.</p>

<p>“And shall we go?” Lettice asked.</p>

<p>“I am not sure. My father, you know, disapproves
of the war, but—”</p>

<p>“Mine doesn’t,” Lettice interrupted triumphantly,
“and perhaps I can get some one to take me.
Should you mind if I did, Rhoda?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go, too,” Rhoda returned, “for
there will be a most distinguished company present:
the President and Mrs. Madison, the Secretaries,
and—oh, everybody. It is to be in honor of the
capture of the <i>Guerrière</i> and the <i>Alert</i>.”</p>

<p>“We must go, if there is any way,” Lettice cried.
“Rhoda, tell me, do you really feel so incensed at
the idea of a war as you pretend?”</p>

<p>Rhoda did not answer at once, and then she said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>slowly, “I think with my father that it is unwise;
but once in it, I think we should do our best to
win.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Lettice. “I’d like to tell Brother
James that.”</p>

<p>“Your brother James?” Rhoda repeated a little
unsteadily. “Has he gone to the war?” She had
not made any inquiry about him, and Lettice had
wickedly refrained from mentioning him.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t gone, exactly. He belongs to the
militia, and so does Brother William, but James
says when Cousin Joe comes back he intends to
join him, for he prefers service at sea.”</p>

<p>“Your cousin Joe, then, has not come back yet?
And his marriage, is it postponed?”</p>

<p>“He has not returned, and the marriage has to
be put off indefinitely. Poor dear Patsey! All those
pretty gowns waiting for her wedding day, and she
does not know when she can wear them! Cousin
Joe made one short trip, and then came back to
Baltimore. He started out again, but not a word
has been heard from him.”</p>

<p>“Poor Patsey!” Rhoda looked very thoughtful
for a moment; then she jumped up from the stiff chair
in which she was sitting. “I’ll write a note, Lettice,”
she said. “I don’t doubt we can go to the ball if
you so desire it. I have friends at court, even if my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
father does not uphold the administration. I can
write to Mrs. Paul Hamilton, who knew my mother
well, and has been most kind to me.”</p>

<p>“The wife of the Secretary of the Navy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she has a son in the navy and a daughter
here. No fear, Lettice, but that we can go with
them, and take Mr. Clinton as our escort.”</p>

<p>Lettice shrugged her shoulders, but made no
comment, though when it was known that they
were to go to the ball, she was in a twitter of
excitement, and declared she meant to captivate
the highest dignitary there, if she could.</p>

<p>“That will not be difficult,” Mr. Clinton murmured,
for her ear alone. The girl turned, and gave him a
little scornful look. Despite the young man’s efforts
at being polite and attentive, he had not met with
much encouragement, and never was allowed an
opportunity for one of those confidential talks he
had found so pleasant during the summer.</p>

<p>Into a gay and brilliantly lighted room in Tomlinson’s
hotel, on the night of December 8, 1812, Rhoda
and Lettice entered. The former looked very fair and
elegant in her India muslin, her delicate features
and fair skin set off by a scarf of pale blue. Lettice,
with her brilliant color, her dancing curls, and pretty
figure, looked not less fair in her gown of pink, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
her floating scarf of white, skilfully embroidered.
They had scarcely come into the ball-room, the
walls of which were decorated with the captured
flags of the <i>Alert</i> and the <i>Guerrière</i>, when there was
heard a great cheering and noise of excitement.
“What is it?” whispered Lettice, half in alarm.</p>

<p>“Nothing to be terrified at, you may be sure,”
returned Mr. Clinton, “for every one is smiling and
eager. See, Mrs. Madison is talking quite gayly.”</p>

<p>Lettice stood on tiptoe the better to see, as into
the room trooped a crowd of young gentlemen all
escorting a young man who bore aloft a flag.</p>

<p>“’Tis young Mr. Hamilton,” cried Rhoda. “See,
Captain Hull and Captain Stewart receive the flag.
They are taking it to Mrs. Madison. It must be a
captured flag.”</p>

<p>Lettice watched while, amid resounding cheers, the
flag was placed by the side of those taken from the
<i>Alert</i> and the <i>Guerrière</i>. “It is a fine sight,” she
exclaimed. “I am so glad I came!”</p>

<p>She was so full of enthusiasm that she did not
notice that she spoke to a stranger, but the young
man addressed smiled down at her and replied: “So
am I. Have you heard what it is all about?”</p>

<p>“No, please tell me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“It is the flag of the <i>Macedonian</i>. She was captured
on October 25, by Captain Decatur of the
frigate <i>United States</i>, and Mr. Hamilton has just
brought official notice of it to his father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you.” Lettice’s lovely eyes were
shining with delight. “I am so glad.”</p>

<p>“Lettice,” came Rhoda’s voice severely. Then
Lettice realized that she did not know this young
man, and blushing, she followed Rhoda’s lead. The
young man stood looking after them. “I wonder
who the dear little girl is,” he said to himself. “I
must find out.”</p>

<p>“Who was that, Lettice?” Rhoda asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Oh, Rhoda, I was so excited
that I spoke to him without realizing that he was
a stranger. I am afraid it was a dreadful thing
to do. Don’t tell Aunt Martha nor Mrs. Hamilton.”</p>

<p>“No, I will not; but you must not do such
things. I shall have to keep a strict eye upon
you.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will,” replied Lettice, meekly.
However, after the supper, when the manager of
the ball proposed as a toast, “Decatur and the
officers and the crew of the frigate <i>United States</i>,”
and after the most exciting evening she had ever
known, as Lettice was about to leave the ball-room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
she turned for one last, parting look, and from
across the room came a smile of recognition from
the strange young gentleman, and though Lettice
was following Rhoda most decorously, she could
not resist an answering smile as she turned away.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Captured.</i></p>


<p>By this time the ports and harbors of the Chesapeake
were declared in a state of blockade,
and after her visit in Washington was over, Lettice
returned to Baltimore to hear that little fleets
of British ships were appearing off the coast.</p>

<p>“You are much safer here than at home,” Mrs.
Tom Hopkins said; “for if the British should come
up the bay, there is no knowing what will happen.
Think how they have burned and plundered lower
Virginia. We may yet see our homes in the country
burned over our heads.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think so, Aunt Martha?” Lettice
asked apprehensively.</p>

<p>“One cannot tell,” Mrs. Hopkins returned, shaking
her head. “Alas, this foolish war! It has
taken my husband from me and may rob me of
my home.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to Boston when Mr. Kendall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>and Rhoda go?” Lettice asked demurely.</p>

<p>“Because my duty is here,” her aunt replied, a
little sharply. “I shall not neglect that for the
sake of my own comfort and convenience. I was
not brought up that way.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a pity that all the Massachusetts people
don’t feel so?” Lettice said slyly.</p>

<p>“Why, child, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that they don’t want the war to go on
because it interferes with their comfort and convenience,
and yet it is their duty to stand by their
country’s rights.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you are talking about,”
replied her aunt. “A chit of a girl like you
doesn’t know anything about politics.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been to Washington, and I heard, oh, so
much talk about it there! I know all about war
matters,” Lettice returned triumphantly. “You
ought to have heard Mr. Clay and Mr. Calhoun!
And even Mr. Randolph, I believe, would think we
ought to defend ourselves if the enemy invades
the country.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins went back to her first grievance.
“And they will invade it. Nothing but discouraging
news from your uncle, and no news at all from
Joseph. We are not strong enough to resist this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>invading foe.”</p>

<p>“But just look at the victories at sea!”</p>

<p>“A few, to be sure; but as soon as the British
are roused to a sense of the real situation, our little
navy will be wiped out. I am told that they have
said they will chastise us into submission.”</p>

<p>“They will, will they? I’d just like to see
them!” Lettice’s eyes flamed, and she stamped
her foot in rage.</p>

<p>“Why, Lettice, what a temper you display!” said
Mrs. Hopkins, viewing Lettice’s angry tears with
disapproval. “You never see Rhoda fairly cry
with temper.”</p>

<p>Lettice’s remembrance of Rhoda’s reserved manner
and her quiet self-control served to calm her.
“I don’t care,” she said. “I know she boils inside,
whether she shows it or not.” Then she sat very
still for a time. A picture of Rhoda’s tranquil
face with its small features, her smooth light
hair, her neat slim figure, rose before her. She
wondered if at that moment she and Robert Clinton
were walking the streets of old Georgetown.
From this her thoughts wandered to the old graveyard,
and she jumped up with a suddenness that
startled her aunt. “Do you suppose, Aunt Martha,”
she said, “that Brother Tom wasn’t drowned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>after all?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins put down her work and looked at
her niece in surprise. “What in the world gave
you that notion, Lettice?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Often when I’ve been down in
the graveyard at home I’ve thought of it.”</p>

<p>“His body was never recovered, it is true,”
Mrs. Hopkins returned thoughtfully. “It is possible,
but not probable, and I’d put any such notion
out of my head, if I were you. He was not only
a trial to your parents, but he was not a benefit
to society.”</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t, and yet, at his best, he was a
dear fellow. No one was so thoughtful of mother,
and no one ever loved me so much as Brother
Tom. Nothing was too much trouble for him to
do for others, and if he had let those wild fellows
alone, he would have been all right.” Lettice’s
eyes were full of tears again, but this time they
were not tears of anger.</p>

<p>Her aunt viewed her with a puzzled smile.
“How you do fly from one thing to another,
child. One minute you are in a rage, and the
next you are melted to tears of sorrow. Come,
give that fantasy no more thought. Run down
and tell Mrs. Flynn that she must not let that
barrel of oysters go to waste, even if we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
them three times a day. We have such a little
family now that it is hard to dispose of things,
but with prices so high, there is need of economy.”
She sighed as she spoke, and Lettice, who
had been planning an excuse to get back to the
country, felt conscience-smitten, and would not
suggest such a thing, now that she realized how
utterly alone her aunt would be.</p>

<p>It was very dull for her in the quiet house, and
Mrs. Hopkins would not allow her to have even
Lutie. She endured Danny, to be sure, because
his master had a fondness for the little fellow,
and, moreover, he made himself useful in many
ways. But Lettice spent a tedious winter, and
though she tried to be patient, and did enjoy a
few frolics, she was glad to see the first signs of
spring.</p>

<p>All through the winter had come cheering
reports of naval victories of more or less importance.
Many prizes had been brought in by the
Baltimore privateers and letters-of-marque, for this
city took the lead in sending out such vessels.
From the port of New York came the news that
Joseph had been successful in capturing more
than one English vessel, and had taken them into
the Northern ports. Thirteen merchant vessels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
were captured off the coast of Spain by one Baltimore
ship alone, and this record was equalled by
more than one gallant cruiser. Not a day passed
but news arrived of some valiant sea-fight. In
February Bainbridge took the <i>Java</i>. In March
the <i>Hornet</i> worsted the <i>Peacock</i>, and the names of
Hull and Decatur, Bainbridge and Jones, were on
every one’s lips. Throughout all this naval warfare
Baltimore was foremost in energetically showing
fight, and against the state of Maryland, in
consequence, the strongest enmity of the foe
seemed to be directed.</p>

<p>It was in April that Rhoda and her father
announced that they would return to Baltimore,
and then Lettice saw that her desire to go home
could be granted, and she wrote to her brother
James to come for her. James, nothing loath,
responded at once, so that he arrived in time to
welcome Rhoda. Under her father’s watchful eye
Rhoda was not very demonstrative in her greetings,
and Mr. Clinton, following close in her wake,
was not received with much enthusiasm by Lettice—a
fact he was not slow to notice and to comment
upon.</p>

<p>“I am coming down to Sylvia’s Ramble again,”
he whispered to Lettice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“When Rhoda comes, I suppose,” Lettice
returned in chilling tones.</p>

<p>“Don’t be jealous,” Mr. Clinton begged.</p>

<p>Lettice turned upon him with scornful eyes.
“Jealous! I jealous? You are vastly mistaken,
sir!” and not another word did she vouchsafe him
the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>The next morning early she and James started
down the bay on one of the packets running from
Baltimore to Queenstown. It did not seem possible
to those whose plantations lay along the
inland creeks that the enemy could have any
object in penetrating into their part of the country;
yet at that very time the British were ravaging
the southern shores of the Chesapeake,
plundering plantations, and carrying off not only
slaves and household valuables, but even robbing
women and children of their clothing. In spite of
their straits but little protection was given them
by the government—this partly because it was not
able—and the unfortunate inhabitants had to protect
themselves as best they could.</p>

<p>On the morning that Lettice and her brother
departed there were lively preparations going on
in the city of Baltimore. Lookout boats were
established far down the river; troops were stationed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
along the shores, for the news had come
that the enemy was approaching, and that Baltimore
was to be the object of attack.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins and the newly arrived visitors
absolutely refused to venture down the bay. “We
will escape in another direction, if need be,” they
said.</p>

<p>“You mean you will stay to welcome your
friends, the British,” Lettice said saucily. “That’s
not what I will do. If we are to meet them, let
it be in our own home.”</p>

<p>“Pray, Miss Lettice,” Mr. Clinton said, “remain
with us. We will have the means to protect you
and your brother—a means which may be lacking
when you pass beyond our influence.”</p>

<p>Lettice shot him a withering glance. “Your
protection, indeed! I’d rather die than be indebted
to your complaisance for my safety!” And
those ever ready and passionate tears began to
gather in her eyes.</p>

<p>Rhoda made a slight movement toward her, but
her father laid his hand on her arm and she passed,
pressing her lips tightly together. Lettice gave a
toss of her head, and said, “Come, Brother James, it is
time we were off; the packet will be starting without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>us.”</p>

<p>“I most devoutly wish it would!” Mr. Clinton
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t!” Lettice retorted, moving toward
the door. “Come, James, cut short your adieux.
Good-by, all of you. I leave you to the tender mercies
of Admiral Cockburn.” And without a turn of
her head she hastened down the street.</p>

<p>James followed and overtook her at the corner.
“You are a spoiled little minx, Letty,” he said.
“Why do you speak so disrespectfully to your elders?”</p>

<p>“Do you perchance mean Robert Clinton? Am
I to have such an inordinate amount of consideration
for him because of his advantage of a few
years?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Robert Clinton, was it? But you included
Mr. Kendall and Aunt Martha in your remarks.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I did, I am glad; I’d not have had the
temerity to attack them but that I was so hot against
that weathercock.”</p>

<p>“Weathercock, is it? Humph!” James was silent
a moment, and then he added, “Weathercocks seem
to be a product of New England.”</p>

<p>“Are they then male and female?” Lettice asked
mischievously. Then seeing her brother’s face
looked really grave and troubled, she linked her arm
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>in his and said coaxingly: “Never mind, Jamie, there
are as good fish in the sea as ever yet were caught,
and one doesn’t need to go so far from home for them.
Let’s whistle these weather-vanes off, and let them
whirl to the tune their north wind blows. Is that
the <i>Patapsco</i>? I’m glad to be aboard her once more.
There seems to be a fair number of passengers in
spite of the alarms. We will have a right merry
time, I reckon. There is Becky Lowe, as I live! and
Tyler Baldwin, and—Come, Jamie, help me up.”
And in a few minutes a jolly little party was established
in one corner of the boat, Lettice and her
brother being welcomed heartily.</p>

<p>“I’m scared to death!” Becky cried. “Jamie, I
was so relieved to see you come aboard; it guarantees
one more protector if we are attacked by the British.
You will fight for me, won’t you?” And she turned
a coquettish glance upon him, moving a little aside
that he might take a seat next her.</p>

<p>Lettice, leaning over the rail, watched the water
as the boat moved out of her dock and started down
the Basin, moving slowly between the shores now
showing their first suggestion of spring.</p>

<p>“Are you scared, Miss Lettice?” asked Tyler
Baldwin by her side.</p>

<p>“No, are you?” she asked, without raising her
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, for you.”</p>

<p>Lettice looked up, startled. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I wish to heaven that all the ladies
were safe inland, miles from the coast. I’ve no confidence
in our being safe, although the captain says
so.”</p>

<p>“What would they do to us if they were to
take us?” asked Lettice, looking sober.</p>

<p>“They’d not treat you ill, I hope, but they
might scare you to death. Miss Lettice, I have
not seen you since your visit to Washington.
Did you enjoy the naval ball?”</p>

<p>“You are changing the subject. Do I look
pale with fright?”</p>

<p>“No, you do not; but it is not a pleasant thing
to anticipate, and I should not have spoken of it.
Why harrow ourselves with what may not happen
at all?”</p>

<p>“Why, indeed. Yes, I was at the ball. How
did you know?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know, positively; I promised to find
out. I judged from the description given me by
one who saw you that it might be you whom my
cousin, Ellicott Baldwin, met.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Is he a naval officer? A young man? Yes,
I see, it is you of whom he reminded me. Did
he tell you—Oh, Tyler, I hope he didn’t think
me a forward piece. I spoke to him in a moment
of excitement, not realizing that he was a stranger.
How came he to mention it?”</p>

<p>“He was most desirous of discovering who you
were. He could not learn your name, and the
best he could do was to find out the names of
your companions. When he told me who they
were, and described you, I was able to tell him
that I was almost certain that the lady of his
fancy was none other than Miss Lettice Hopkins,
of Queen Anne’s County. Do not trouble yourself
over having met him in so chance a way; he
has only admiration for you, and spoke of you in
a most respectful manner. He told me of your
meeting, and some day—Heavens! what is
that?”</p>

<p>They both started up, for the boat was now
opposite North Point, and they saw bearing down
upon them several small vessels belonging to
the enemy’s squadron which lay just within the
mouth of the river. Soon followed a scene of
confusion. Becky Lowe fell fainting into James’s
arms. Lettice, with pale face and imploring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>eyes, clung close to Tyler Baldwin. “What will
they do?” she whispered. “Shall you have to
fight?”</p>

<p>“It would do little good, and so I think the
captain will conclude. In such a case discretion
is the better part of valor. The captain, for the
sake of all concerned, will probably submit with
the best grace he can summon. We are not prepared
for a battle.” And the event proved the
truth of his words.</p>

<p>“We are prisoners,” said Tyler, after returning
to her from a tour of investigation. “All
we have to do is to make the best of it.
They are preparing to put us under guard, and
are helping themselves to whatever they can
find.”</p>

<p>Becky had recovered sufficiently to sit sobbing
by James’s side. He was trying to comfort her,
and looked pleadingly at his sister, that she might
understand that her assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>“Come, Becky,” said Lettice, in quiet tones,
“there is no use fussing over the matter. We
may be thankful that we are not hurt, and that
there is not going to be any fighting. I think
we should submit with dignity, and show them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>what stuff American girls are made of.” But
Becky was not to be comforted at once and continued
weeping hysterically.</p>

<p>“Law, Becky,” Lettice said, at last out of patience,
“you fairly provoke me. What is the use
of your snivelling and sniffling? There is nothing
to be gained by it, and you only draw attention to
yourself; that is what you want, I shall believe,
if you don’t stop. Look at Sally Weeks, she is
as still as a mouse.” Nevertheless, in spite of
any effort to make light of the situation, it was
a hard ordeal for them all; for instead of reaching
their homes that evening, as they had expected,
they were all night under guard, and the next
morning saw a wan and weary company.</p>

<p>“How much longer shall we be kept here?”
Lettice asked her brother, wistfully. But the answer
came with the order to remove the prisoners
to an old boat. “You are allowed a permit
from the admiral to proceed to Queenstown,”
they were told, and they did not dare to resent
the impertinence of the message.</p>

<p>It was a long and uncomfortable trip which was
before them; for with scarcely any food, and with
no water at all, after their night of detention, and
upon a miserable hulk of a boat, which made but
slow progress, it was as forlorn a company as one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
might wish to see, which at last landed at Queenstown
in Chester River. But the effect of this was
that not one of the party but felt that when the
moment came, he or she would do the utmost to
work revenge.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>First Blood.</i></p>


<p>“Cockburn is coming!” This was the news
that was borne from lip to lip, and Lettice
was made to repeat her experience over and over. It
must be said that she did rather needlessly enlarge
upon the terrors of the occasion when Lutie was the
listener, and the eyes of that sable maiden grew
bigger and bigger as Lettice described Admiral
Cockburn’s appearance: a great big man, as tall as
a locust tree, with fiery red hair and blazing eyes and
a long beard that blew out like the tail of a comet;
so he appeared to Lutie’s vision, her imagination
adding hoofs and horns; and he became the theme
of Jubal’s perorations, taking the place of “Poly
Bonypart” as a bugaboo to scare the children and
the more timid girls. And not without reason; for a
terrifying account of a raid upon Havre-de-Grâce
and other towns in the upper Chesapeake was cause
enough for alarm.</p>

<p>It was Birket Dean who came galloping over with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
news: “Cockburn, with a big force of men, has been
playing havoc up in Kent and Cecil counties, and
even beyond. Havre-de-Grâce has suffered; every
one has been plundered, and the ravagers weren’t
satisfied with that, but went up the Sassafras and
destroyed Fredericktown and Georgetown. They
say that the women pleaded and begged that he would
spare their homes, but he refused, and the houses
were burned to the ground; and he says he’ll not be
satisfied till he has burned every building in Baltimore.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does he mean to go there next?” Lettice
asked in excitement.</p>

<p>“They say he doubtless did intend to, but he has
heard through his friends among the Peace men that
the lookout boats are stationed all the way down
the <i>Patapsco</i>, and that there are videttes along the
shores of the bay and the river, and besides, the City
Brigade will be ready for them. They fired alarm
guns in Baltimore and had all the troops out, but the
redcoats passed by Annapolis and Baltimore and
went to the upper bay. A great many people moved
out of the city, I am told.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose there can really be any danger
of their coming here?” Betty asked, holding her
baby very closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>The men looked at each other and were silent,
then William, caressing the top of his little son’s
silky head, said, “If they do, we’ll defend our
homes to the last drop of blood.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll not leave us, William?” said Betty,
scanning his face eagerly.</p>

<p>“My place is near home, I have determined,” he
replied, smiling down at her.</p>

<p>The next few days brought tales of further
marauding; tales of such horror that Betty and
Lettice clung to each other in terror. And, indeed,
the atrocities committed were such that in some
places the word “Hampton” was used instead of
“Attention” to call the men to order, and the
accounts of the terrible ravages lessened greatly the
number of those who opposed the war.</p>

<p>But as days went by and no Cockburn appeared,
the fears even of those most easily frightened were
quelled, and affairs went on as usual.</p>

<p>“It’s desperately tiresome, this staying at
home,” Lettice said to her brother James. “I
don’t mean to do it any longer. Would there
be any harm, do you think, in our going out for
a wee bit of a way on the water? We know full
well that the British are away down the bay, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>I haven’t had a sail this many a day. Do take
me out, Jamie, or I’ll go alone.” It was a lovely
morning in July, somewhat warm, and promising
greater heat. Lettice sat discontentedly on the
lower step of the porch, looking off toward the
creek.</p>

<p>“You’ll not go alone,” said James, swinging
his long legs over the railing of the porch, and
sitting down beside her.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll take me.”</p>

<p>“Yes; there’s not a sail in sight, and I reckon
we’ll have it all to ourselves, besides—”</p>

<p>“Besides what?”</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to be at Queenstown when the
boat comes in.”</p>

<p>Lettice turned and looked at him. “Why?
You have a reason. I see it in your eyes.”</p>

<p>“So I have.” He took a letter from his pocket
and held it off at a little distance. Lettice made
a grab for it, but he caught her hand, and laughing,
held her firmly. “It isn’t for you,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Whose is it, then?”</p>

<p>“Mine.”</p>

<p>“Let me see the handwriting. Please do, Jamie.”</p>

<p>He held the letter at a careful distance, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>she read the address in Rhoda’s neat hand: Mr.
James Hopkins. “From Rhoda! Oh, is she
coming down on the packet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, so the letter says, and will I meet her
and Aunt Martha. It seems that Aunt Martha
has been ill, and the city is hot, so she thinks she
may venture down to this neighborhood; unwisely,
I think, with the enemy so near and ready to
pounce on us at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Now, James, quit talking so to scare me. And
where is Rhoda’s devoted cavalier, that she must
call on you for an escort?”</p>

<p>“I do not know where he is; her father has
gone to Philadelphia, and probably the young man
is there too; they seem to travel in company.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they went on the new steamboat.
I should think they would go that way; such a
novelty as it is.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they did; Rhoda does not say.”</p>

<p>“Well come, then; if we are to meet the packet,
we ought to be off. I hope there will be news from
father. It seems a long time between letters, and
so very long since we have seen him. I think I
will take Lutie along with me, and we can stay all
night at Sylvia’s Ramble. I’ll run in while you
get the boat ready and tell Sister Betty that we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>are going.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go, Letty,” Betty advised. “Suppose
you should encounter the British.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not, I am sure; they are away off down
the bay, and we’ll not go far.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you wouldn’t go at all. James
ought to have more sense than to take you.”</p>

<p>“He had to, because I told him I’d go alone
if he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Sauce-box! you’d do no such thing.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Lettice, you wouldn’t. Don’t you ever dare
to do such a thing. Remember Hampton.”</p>

<p>Lettice looked suddenly grave. “I reckon I’d
better not go alone,” she said, as she turned away.</p>

<p>“It is such a lovely afternoon for a sail,” she
remarked, as she settled herself in the boat. “You
don’t expect to shoot any game, do you, Jamie?
What’s the gun for?”</p>

<p>“For defence, if need be, and this pistol, too.”
He laid it down by the side of the gun.</p>

<p>Lutie put both hands to her ears. “Law, Mars
Jeems, yuh ain’t gwine in de way o’ dem Britishers,
is yuh?” she asked in terror.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to get in their way if I can
help it, but they may get in ours. I think, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>all, Lettice, you and Lutie had best go back.”</p>

<p>“Not I!” Lettice returned. “I’m here, and here
I’ll stay, Britisher or no Britisher. I don’t mean
to have you go alone; besides, Aunt Martha is not
well, and I ought to go over as soon as I can, she
might need me.”</p>

<p>“Rhoda said they might need me, not you.”</p>

<p>“How self-satisfied some one is all of a sudden!
I say they may need me. Now, push off; there’s
no use parleying. I’ll jump in and swim there
if you don’t hurry.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are capable of it,” Jamie returned.</p>

<p>“Of course I am. I am sure the packet would
not be running if there were any danger, and you
told me, yourself, that none of the enemy had
been seen around here.”</p>

<p>“I know I did; I would bear you back to the
house by force if I thought there would be any
danger for you. At all events, we’ll trust to luck,
and get over to the landing as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“We’ve plenty of time, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then do let us stop at Betty’s cove. Mrs.
Cooke promised me a plant, and I’ve long wanted
a chance to get it.”</p>

<p>James consented, and before long they were turning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>into a little creek which lay back of Mr. Cooke’s
property. The boat, however, hardly touched her
moorings before a shout was heard, and two men
started up from behind some bushes, crying: “Halt
there! We’ve got you, have we, you foul deserter!”</p>

<p>James, who had scarce set foot on shore, turned
and dealt the man about to grab him a heavy
blow; but before he could regain his footing upon
the boat, the second man gave a shout, and a couple
of others came running from a small boathouse near
by. The first seized James and dragged him off,
despite his manful resistance.</p>

<p>For a moment Lettice was nearly paralyzed with
fright, then she recovered her wits, and, grabbing
the gun, she pointed it at James’s assailant. The
gun was heavy, and her hands trembled with the
weight of it. Suppose she should shoot wildly and
kill her brother. With a swift, silent prayer that
James might be spared, she took aim, fired, and
dropped the gun. “Hand me the pistol,” she cried
to Lutie. “Run, Jamie, now’s your chance!” she
shouted, for one of the men holding James, being
wounded in the shoulder by the shot Lettice had
fired, had dropped his prisoner’s arm; and James,
with a wrench, tore himself from the remaining
hold upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

</figure>

<p>He had too often shared in the athletic sports
common upon holidays not to be a good runner,
and he was but an instant in reaching the edge
of the water; dashing in, he swam around to the
other side of the vessel, which was slowly drifting
farther and farther out, Lettice meanwhile standing
resolutely pointing her pistol at his pursuers.
“Lutie,” she cried, without turning her head,
“pick up that axe, and if any one dares to touch
this boat, brain him. You hear me?”</p>

<p>Lutie, though quaking with fear, gained courage
from the attitude of her young mistress and picked
up the axe. “Come on,” she yelled. “Come on,
yuh po’ white trash, yuh! Jes’ lemme ketch one
o’ yuh techin’ mah young mistis, an’ I’ll lay dis
axe ’bout yo neck lak yuh was a chicken fo’
brilin’. Yuh ole good-fo’-nothin’ tu’key buzza’ds,
yuh!” She stood with axe raised, and the two
defenders of the little vessel did present such a
formidable aspect that the men fell back. Only
one or two were prepared to fire. They had been
disturbed in the taking of an afternoon nap, and
had previously divested themselves of all superfluous
accoutrements. Therefore, though one or
two bullets whizzed across the bows of the vessel
as she retreated, not one touched the occupants.</p>

<p>Slowly, farther and farther out the little craft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
floated, and finally James, who had scrambled
aboard, was setting sail for the opposite shore, and
told Lettice they were beyond danger. “I feel
like a cowardly wretch,” he said, “to run from the
foe at the very moment you needed me for defence.
What would have happened to us all, but
for my brave little sister?”</p>

<p>And then Lettice sank down and began to cry
hysterically, thus demanding Lutie’s administrations;
and for some time the maid found herself
fully occupied in soothing her young mistis. “Law,
Miss Letty, yuh is safe,” she repeated. “Huccome
yuh cry when ’taint nobody daid?”</p>

<p>“I want to go home, I want to go home!
Jamie, take me home!” Lettice wailed.</p>

<p>“I will, sis. We are getting there as fast as
we can. Don’t you see we have turned about and
are going back?”</p>

<p>“And you won’t go to meet the packet? Say
you won’t.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that now. If I do go, it
will be on horseback, and I will go around by the
road; so you needn’t worry about that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to go,” Lettice persisted. “I
don’t want you out of my sight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>James laughed. “You’re funny, sis. I can’t
help laughing at you. A minute ago you were so
fierce and valiant, and now you’re weeping and
going on like a baby.”</p>

<p>“But you’re all wet,” sobbed Lettice.</p>

<p>“Suppose I am? That’s nothing; and on a
hot afternoon, too. I have often been as wet as
this when I’ve been out ducking, and when it was
a good bit colder. Come, sit up here and help me.
We shall have to tack across, for the wind has
died down.”</p>

<p>“You are sure you are not hurt at all?” said
Lettice, drying her eyes.</p>

<p>“No, not a bit. I look rather the worse for
wear, that is all.”</p>

<p>“It was so awful to see them dragging you
off,” and Lettice burst into tears again.</p>

<p>“They didn’t drag me very far, did they?
Thanks to my little soldier girl of a sister. There,
honey, don’t cry any more; we’re nearly home.”
And he hugged and petted her till, by the time
they reached their own landing, she had somewhat
calmed down. But as James led her up the
steps to her sister Betty, she lapsed again into a
woful state, and it required the combined efforts
of Mammy, Dorcas, Lutie, and Betty to quiet her;
for one minute she would burst into wild laughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
as she looked at Lutie, and would say, “She
looked so funny standing there threatening to
chop off their heads like chickens,” and then she
would fall to weeping because it was so awful to
see them dragging off her brother. At last, under
the combined effects of red lavender, salts, and
finally a mint-julep, she fell asleep. “I don’t
trust you off this place again without me,” said
Betty, bending over the exhausted little figure and
kissing the white forehead around which damp
curls clustered. And with Mammy to fan her on
one side, and Lutie on the other, she was left in
the quiet of her own room.</p>

<p>James hurried off his wet clothes, donned another
suit, and springing upon his horse, galloped across
country to the landing, arriving just in time to
see the packet come in, and to welcome his aunt
and Rhoda. A flush mounted to his face when he
saw in attendance Mr. Robert Clinton. “I don’t
see what they needed me for,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Mr. Clinton surprised us by arriving from
Philadelphia last night,” Rhoda told him. “My
father was not willing that I should come down
here, he sent word.”</p>

<p>“But you came. Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>“Because it is my duty to remain with my aunt,
and I cannot let my personal convenience stand in
the way of duty,” replied Rhoda, a little primly.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Clinton came because it was his duty,
or because you did, which?” said James, in a
vexed tone.</p>

<p>“My father would have it so. When he learned
that I intended to remain with Aunt Martha, he
said that he should prefer that we have the protection
of either Mr. Clinton or himself, and since
his affairs did not permit of his presence here
just now, he sent Mr. Clinton.”</p>

<p>“I see.” James looked at her fixedly, and she
looked down, blushing faintly.</p>

<p>“Where is Lettice?” she asked, to turn the subject.
James told her of their late experience.</p>

<p>Rhoda shivered. “Is it as bad as that?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and may be worse. I wish you had not
come down.”</p>

<p>Rhoda bit her lip. “Aunt Martha insisted,” she
murmured.</p>

<p>“Unwisely, I think. I should advise that you
return at once.”</p>

<p>Rhoda shook her head. “I will stay as long as
Aunt Martha does. She will need me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“But you will persuade her that there is danger?”</p>

<p>“I will try.”</p>

<p>But Aunt Martha, once she took a decision, was
not to be moved, and she refused utterly to return
to the city, saying that her husband’s interests
demanded her presence on the plantation, and she
felt it her duty to remain at all hazards. “The place
will go to rack and ruin while he is away, if I don’t
look out for it,” she declared, “and I cannot neglect
my husband’s affairs when he is away. I am willing
to take the risks, for I think my presence may be a
saving means for us all, in case of a visit from those
bands of foragers.”</p>

<p>And therefore Lettice heard with mixed feelings
that her uncle’s home was likely to hold for some
time, not only her aunt and Rhoda, but Robert
Clinton.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Love and Politics.</i></p>


<p>The presence of the enemy in the neighborhood
convinced every one of the necessity of
taking every precaution to protect themselves and
their property. At first alarm many persons had hidden
their plate and other valuables, and many had
sent their families farther inland. But beyond the
discomforts occasioned by raids, when houses were
sacked and often burned to the ground, and when
slaves were enticed away, the people of Maryland
did not suffer as much as did those of lower Virginia.
Where there was no marked resistance, and where
there was no reason to suppose the heads of families
were in the American army, allowance was made for
property taken, and pay given. Therefore Aunt
Martha had reason on her side when she said, “I
shall simply let them take what they want and shall
expect pay for it.”</p>

<p>“That is not what we will do,” Lettice said. “We
are not going to pretend that we are friends, but of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
course it is different with you, Aunt Martha.” Lettice
had recovered from her fright and was really
enjoying life. If James lost no opportunity in visiting
Sylvia’s Ramble, neither did Robert Clinton fail
to make a daily appearance at Hopkins’s Point, till
Lettice came to look for his coming as part of her
day’s pleasure. He was truly a very attractive young
man, every one conceded.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a word against him,” said Lettice’s
brother William, “except for his politics. You’ll not
go over to the enemy, will you, sis?” he said, pinching
her cheek.</p>

<p>“Never!” returned Lettice, steadily. Nevertheless,
the telltale blush upon her cheek was not caused by
the pink sunbonnet she wore. The little maid of
seventeen found it hard to remember her politics
when she was listening to the beguiling words of the
young New Yorker, who by this time had declared
himself her devoted suitor.</p>

<p>“Why do you deny me, sweet Lettice?” he said.
“Must I leave you altogether? Am I so hateful to
you?” This was but the night before, when the two
were coming home from a frolic at Becky Lowe’s.</p>

<p>“There is Rhoda, you know,” Lettice had answered
in a low tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“Rhoda, yes; but—” he looked down as he gathered
Lettice’s hand in his—“but you see, I don’t love
Rhoda, nor does she love me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” Lettice asked, wondering
if it were right to allow her hand to lie so long in his
clasp.</p>

<p>“I know that Rhoda feels toward me as I do toward
her. We are excellent friends. I admire and respect
her greatly, and to no one would I be more
ready to give my confidence, for she is discretion
itself; but I know full well who it is that has captured
my heart, and besides, did you see your brother
James and Rhoda as we passed them just now? I
do not think they were thinking of either of us.”</p>

<p>“No, I did not notice them, I wasn’t looking;
besides, Rhoda doesn’t love James’s politics any more
than I do yours.”</p>

<p>“Politics? What have sweet lasses like you to
do with politics? Let the men settle the affairs
of the nation, and let the maidens rule in the
court of love, where they are more at home.”</p>

<p>Then Lettice sighed and did not draw her hand
away. The witching moonlight, the summer night,
the low pleading tones of her lover—all these cast
a glamour over her, and so swayed her that it
seemed that the present alone was the only thing
to consider, and Robert walked across the fields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
to Sylvia’s Ramble, feeling that his wooing would
soon come to a happy ending.</p>

<p>And yet, the next morning Lettice said never
would she go over to the enemy. “I told Brother
William I never would. I have promised him,”
she said to herself, as she ran swiftly along
the path to the old graveyard. Lutie started up
from where she was sitting before one of the
cabins in the quarter, but Lettice waved her back.
“I don’t want you, Lutie,” she said. “You can
go back.”</p>

<p>“Whar yuh gwine, Miss Letty?”</p>

<p>“Never mind where I am going. I don’t need
you, and I don’t want you to follow me. Stay
where you are.”</p>

<p>“Miss Letty gwine whar she gwine. She got
no use fo’ nobody dis mawnin’,” Lutie remarked
to the old woman before whose cabin she sat.</p>

<p>Lettice made a detour and came around by the
rear of the old graveyard. The thicket was closer
here, and hid her from the view of any one passing.
She threw herself down in the long grass, hiding
her face in her arm. “I said that, and I am
afraid I am growing to love him,” she murmured.
“I have made one promise to my brother, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>how can I make another to him?” She lay still
a long time, and once in a while a tear trickled
down her cheek.</p>

<p>Presently she sat up. A sudden thought had
struck her. Suppose she could win her lover over
to her side of thinking. That would be a triumph
indeed! Why shouldn’t she? Did he love her, he
certainly would not give her up; yet as she pondered
upon the subject, she felt that she was by
no means certain of the success of her effort, and
her face grew grave again.</p>

<p>From over the hedge came a voice, calling
softly, “Lettice! Sweet Lettice, where have you
hidden yourself?”</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet and stood where she
could be seen. Robert pressed aside the detaining
vines and came up to her. “Lettice, sweetheart,
I could not stay away. Do you forgive me for
coming so early? Was it a dream? a beautiful
dream which I had last night, or did I see a light
in your dear eyes? I love you so, sweet Lettice,
that I could not sleep last night for thinking of
you.” He gently pushed back the sunbonnet she
had drawn over her face. “Sweetheart, you have
been weeping,” he said in a troubled tone. “Your
sweet eyes are wet. What is wrong?”</p>

<p>Lettice gave a little sob, and for one moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
yielded to the clasp of his arm, burying her hot
face on his breast. She felt a sudden joy to be
thus near him, to hear him speak, but only for
an instant she allowed herself to remain thus, and
then she sprang away, and stood a little beyond
him. “Tell me,” she said, “do you love me
enough to join the cause of my father and my
brothers?”</p>

<p>He looked at her gloomily, and then, leaning on
the tall headstone which her movement had placed
between them, he said slowly: “Do you make that
an issue between us? You love me less than you
love the platform upon which rests the opinion of
certain members of your family?”</p>

<p>She looked troubled in her turn. There was a
long pause. An utter stillness prevailed. Once in
a while a bird darted from the faintly rustling
leaves. The distant sound of water plashing
against the side of the bay shores, or the murmur
of voices from the fields struck their ears.
Lettice noted these things unconsciously, and with
them the faint odors of the growing greenness
about her, and the shapes of the shadows on the
grass. She drew a long breath. “You do not
love me, if you are willing to lose me because I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>love my country.”</p>

<p>“It is my country, too. There is not a difference
in our love for our native land, but in our
belief in what is good for her. I believe that
the war is unrighteous and will be the country’s
ruin. I am hostile to nothing except the war. I
am for peace at any cost. You pin your faith on
your father’s beliefs, that is all; and it cannot, it
shall not, separate us.” He made a step toward
her, but she drew back.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried. “While my father is fighting
on the Canada border, so far away, perhaps
at this moment lying wounded, or dead,” she
whispered, “can I promise myself to one who is
willing to encourage his foes to work his destruction?
No, I cannot, I cannot!”</p>

<p>The young man turned aside and leaned heavily
against a gnarled old tree which overshadowed
them, and again there was silence. When Robert
spoke, it was very quietly. “That I would encourage
a foe of yours is a thought too terrible to
contemplate; that I could ever do aught to bring
you one moment’s pang seems to me impossible.
The war cannot last. I do not give you up, I
but wait till the war is over, and then—Lettice!”
He held out his hands yearningly, but she did not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>move. “Promise me, dearest, promise me, that
when the question is settled, that you will no
longer deny me my place, and meantime keep me
in your heart.”</p>

<p>“Provided you do us no wrong, provided you
do nothing to bring trouble upon us, after the
war—I will—consider it.”</p>

<p>“Even that ray of hope is much. I make this
concession, and you, dearest, can never know what
it costs: I promise to take no active part in the
measures against the carrying on of the war. I
have been an earnest partisan, I acknowledge; yet
I will henceforth be a neutral. God forgive me,
if I am wrong; if to win your favor is more to me
than the approval of my countrymen. Can you
not give me a proof of a like measure of love?”</p>

<p>“If when the war is over, you come to me with
hands unstained, and with a conscience clean of
having done no injury to our side, I think I may,
perhaps, be ready to promise you—what you ask.”
She hung her head, and the last words were in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“And you will seal the bond, beloved, you
will?” He advanced and would have kissed her,
but she retreated, crying:—</p>

<p>“No, no, the war is not over yet.” She spoke
gayly, however, and held out her hand, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
pressed to his lips. But just then Lutie’s voice
broke in upon them.</p>

<p>“Miss Letty, Miss Betty say huccome yuh fo’git
yuh-alls is gwine to yo Aunt Marthy’s to dinner?
She say yuh bleedged ter come an’ git dressed
e’ssen dey leave yuh ’thout nothin’ but cold pone.”
Lutie’s giggle followed the message, and Lettice,
with Robert at her side, took her way to the
house.</p>

<p>“Law, Letty,” cried Betty, meeting her in the
hall, “you certainly are feather-brained these days.
Here I am all ready, and you are mooning about,
nobody knows where. It is high time we were off.
This is to be a state dinner, remember, and Aunt
Martha will never forgive us if we are late.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what time it was,” said Lettice,
as she ran upstairs.</p>

<p>Aunt Martha’s state dinners were rather dreary
affairs. Solemn dinings to which dignified heads
of families were invited. In this instance it was
in honor of an elderly bride that the invitations
were sent out. One of Mr. Hopkins’s cousins had
taken to himself a second wife, and Lettice did
not anticipate any great joviality; yet her hopes
were high, for she had gained a great point, she
considered. Robert would be true to his promise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
she knew he would; and if the war would but end,
then he would make his request of her father in
proper form, and her father would not refuse.
She was entirely unworldly in her thought of it all,
and hardly gave a passing consideration to the fact
that her lover was a wealthy man, and considered
an excellent match; all that troubled her was his
politics. She stopped so often, and was so preoccupied
in the making of her toilet, that Lutie
finally exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Yuh sholy mus’ be in lub, Miss Letty. Yuh
ain’t gwine put on bofe dem scarfs, is yuh?”</p>

<p>Then Lettice laughed and told Lutie she was a
saucy minx, that if she didn’t behave she should
be sent out with the field hands. And Lutie, who
knew just what that threat amounted to, having
frequently heard it before, giggled and further remarked
that: “Mars Clinton a mighty fine gemman,”
and when Miss Letty went to New York to live,
Lutie hoped she wasn’t “gwine be lef’ behin’,” for
which speech she received a rap of Lettice’s
knuckles, and then mistress and maid descended
the stairs, the latter as proud of her young lady,
in her best summer attire, as the young lady was
of herself.</p>

<p>It may have been that Lettice was not willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
to risk sitting by Betty’s side under the ardent
gaze of her lover on the opposite seat of the carriage,
and with Betty to watch every glance of his
eye, for at the last moment she declared that she
wanted Jamie to drive her over, and would wait
for him, and wouldn’t the others please go on
without her.</p>

<p>“You are a contrary little piece,” said Betty,
out of patience. “Here you have kept us waiting
all this time, and now you won’t go with us.
Why didn’t you say so in the first place?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of it,” returned Lettice, calmly.
“You flustered me so by telling me it was late,
that I forgot about Jamie.” And seeing she was
bound to have her own way, Betty and Mr. Clinton
drove off without her.</p>

<p>The company had all assembled when the last
guests from Hopkins’s Point reached Sylvia’s Ramble,
and Lettice wished she had come earlier
when she saw that Mr. Clinton was at the gate
to meet her, and that with him in attendance
she would be obliged to pass under the scrutiny
of a dozen mature cousins, each of whom felt it
a prerogative to make as many personal remarks
as he or she desired; so that the girl was glad to
escape with Rhoda, who, though critical, was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
so aggressively candid as one’s relatives are likely
to be.</p>

<p>The guests, although knowing that Mrs. Tom
Hopkins was a Boston woman, supposed her frankly
siding with her husband, and therefore they did
not scruple to discuss at the dinner-table politics
from their point of view. News of the Remonstrance
Act of Massachusetts had just been received,
and those favoring the war policy were
hot against the Bay State, and did not hesitate
to voice their feelings.</p>

<p>“With our brave Lawrence not cold in his grave,”
said Mr. Jacob Seth, “the Massachusetts people
adopt a resolution that it is not becoming a moral
and religious people to express any approbation of
military or naval exploits not immediately connected
with the defence of their sea-coast and
their soil.”</p>

<p>“And it was in Boston harbor that the fight
between the <i>Chesapeake</i> and the <i>Shannon</i> took
place,” said another guest.</p>

<p>Rhoda bit her lip and glanced quickly at James,
who regarded her with an amused look, while
Lettice’s eyes sought Robert. His face was
flushed, and he was looking steadfastly into his
plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“Massachusetts believes the war to be caused
by ambition and desire for conquest,” put in Aunt
Martha, stiffly.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Cousin Martha,” said Mr.
Seth, “we forget that you are not a Marylander.
Cousin Tom has taken such a decided stand, that
we do not realize that perhaps you may be less
enthusiastic. The women of our land whose husbands
have gone to the war could scarcely be expected
to approve it.”</p>

<p>“It is not a cheerful subject, anyhow,” the bride
remarked.</p>

<p>“And I am sure the occasion warrants a livelier
one,” returned Mr. Seth, gallantly. And they fell
to chaffing each other, and in the end, Lettice
declared a more pleasant dinner she had never
enjoyed at Aunt Martha’s.</p>

<p>“I am surprised that Robert did not immediately
take up the cudgels; he is not wont to be so circumspect,”
said Rhoda, musingly, as she and Lettice
were walking in the garden.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?” returned Lettice. “Perhaps we are
converting him to our way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“That would scarcely be possible,” Rhoda replied.
“He is pledged to support his cause, and is too
ardent an adherent to give in easily. My father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
says he is a strong aid to him, and he depends
much upon him in various important matters,
although Robert is so much the younger.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that is true,” said Lettice, thoughtfully.
“I do not wonder, then, that he is anxious
that you should be fond of each other. How about
it, Rhoda?” she asked teasingly.</p>

<p>Rhoda showed no special emotion except by the
nervous closing of her hand. “When the war is
over,” she replied, “these vexing, political problems
will not interfere with our decisions in other
directions, as now they must do.”</p>

<p>“That is very true, Rhoda,” Lettice answered
softly. “Let us suppose the war over, and each
of us free to act as she would? Is there then no
reason why you should not favor Mr. Clinton?
What says your heart?”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked her squarely in the eyes. “I admire
Robert. I have known him since I was a
little child. He is entirely worthy any woman’s
regard.” Then suddenly. “And you? What
does your heart say?”</p>

<p>Lettice looked confused; then she replied, laughing,
“I’ll tell you when the war is over.”</p>

<p>Rhoda regarded her gravely. “Robert Clinton
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>will never desert his party,” she said; “and I
think he will spare no means to forward the interests
of those whose opinions he endorses.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” Lettice returned lightly; “but men
are not infallible. The best of them are mistaken
sometimes, and he may yet change. Rhoda, would
or could any one in the world make you differ from
your father in politics?”</p>

<p>Red grew Rhoda’s cheeks. “I don’t know,”
she returned faintly.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Suspicions.</i></p>


<p>So far, with the exception of the raid into the
upper Chesapeake, the eastern shore of Maryland
had not suffered greatly from the enemy’s
depredations, but during the spring and summer
of 1813, St. Mary’s County, on the western shore,
was seldom safe from marauders, who plundered
and burned and destroyed till the people were
reduced to extreme poverty. The men compelled
to perform constant military duty received no
help from the government, and in consequence
of the deplorable condition of affairs, many took
their families and emigrated to the far West. During
the summer over one thousand volunteers
and recruits were sent from Maryland to the
Canada border, sadly as their help was needed at
home.</p>

<p>Many of the people of the Eastern shore, with
the enemy terrorizing them, likewise abandoned
their homes; for Kent Island, a point lying directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
opposite the city of Annapolis, was taken possession
of by the enemy early in August, and when
three thousand British troops landed, it was to
find but a small remnant of the population left.
From this point foraging expeditions were constantly
sent out, keeping the inhabitants of the
neighboring shores in a constant state of uneasiness.
On August 8, three ships of the line, five
frigates, three brigs, two schooners, and some
smaller vessels, advanced toward Baltimore, but
the prompt appearance of those who were determined
to defend the city, and the visible preparations
which had been made, were sufficient to
ward off any attack, and the enemy moved off and
threatened Annapolis which lay across the bay
from their station on Kent Island. Here likewise
there was no lack of preparation, and the British
finally withdrew.</p>

<p>All this set astir those in the neighborhood of
Lettice’s home. Many fled, and those who had
not already buried their valuables, or had not
placed them in some safe hiding, made haste to
do so. Lettice and Betty had long since seen to
it that the family treasures were safely hidden; but
since no one knew where the next attack might
be made, they declared that as far as their personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
safety went, they might as well be in one
place as another.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of August 7, that William
came hurriedly in, saying: “The British are
making for our shores! I must hurry off, Betty.
Don’t look so terrified, my love. I trust we
shall not suffer from the attack, but the militia
are ordered out, and James and I must go. Here,
Lettice, take these papers and put them in safe
hiding somewhere; they are valuable. I ought to
see to it myself, but I shall not have time. If
anything happens, get over to Uncle Tom’s as
quickly as possible. I fancy Aunt Martha can
hold her own, and there is strength in numbers.”
And kissing his weeping wife and trembling sister,
he mounted his horse and was off, accompanied by
James, who made his adieux with a last whisper
to Lettice, “If I fall, Lettice, give this little packet
to Rhoda.”</p>

<p>Lettice nodded, too full of distress to speak, and
the two women, holding each other closely, watched
the young men as they galloped out of sight.
“Oh, Lettice, Lettice,” Betty sobbed, “suppose we
never see them again!”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” cried Lettice, sharply. “Betty, don’t
say such things. Let us busy ourselves about something,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
or we shall not be fit to face trouble when it
comes. I must hide these papers at once.” She
concealed them under her apron, and stole through
the orchard to the graveyard, where, dropping on
her knees, she hastily dug a hole close by the leaning
footstone of Theophilus Hopkins’s grave, and
in the cavity she placed the box of papers. From
time to time she glanced apprehensively around to
be sure that no one observed her, and she was
startled in the very act of covering up the place
of hiding, by hearing some one say: “I knew I
should find you here. Are you honoring your
ancestor by planting fresh flowers upon his grave?
It is rather late in the season, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Lettice, looking greatly confused, stammered: “I—yes—no,
I was not. It is rather late for some
flowers, to be sure, but some can be planted at
almost any time, you know.” As she recovered
herself, she spoke with more assurance. “How
long have you been watching me, Mr. Clinton?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Only a few moments. I saw you digging
away for dear life, but I didn’t disturb you, for
I liked to watch your little white hands.” He
tried to take them in his, but Lettice drew them
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“They are all covered with earth and stuff,” she
said. “You came very early.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I came from your aunt with a message.
We have heard that the British are moving in this
direction, and Mrs. Hopkins thinks you will all be
safer under her roof. I suppose your brothers are
off at first alarm.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they have gone; but I am not sure what
Betty will consent to do. The negroes, to be sure,
are scattering off toward the woods, and our being
here will scarcely keep them together. The older
and more faithful ones will stay anyhow, and we
could take Lutie, and Mammy, and Speery with us.
Jubal has been stirring them all up with his fearsome
tales, and I shouldn’t be surprised if he
coaxed off a lot of the field hands. I never did
trust Jubal,” she said meditatively.</p>

<p>“Then I will escort you over, if your sister
consents.”</p>

<p>Lettice agreed, and they started for the house.
“Do you know if it is simply a foraging party of
British on the way here, or is it really a large
force?” Lettice asked.</p>

<p>“I believe it is quite a large force; at least I
was told so by some one who brought the news.
A company of scouts under Captain Massey made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
the discovery that the British were advancing, and
there has been a skirmish. Major Nicholson and
his troops are at Queenstown, which I believe is
expected to be the point of attack.”</p>

<p>“Has it come to that? Then we may look for
anything. I am sure Brother William would want
to have us go to Uncle Tom’s.”</p>

<p>They found Betty quite willing to follow Mr.
Clinton’s advice; therefore, taking the baby and
three of the servants, they hastened over to Sylvia’s
Ramble, to find Mrs. Hopkins somewhat nervous,
but outwardly determined, while Rhoda was quietly
alert, and not the least discomposed, to all appearances.</p>

<p>Lettice, eager and anxious, was at times so preoccupied
that she scarcely heeded what Robert said
to her. Once she turned on him fiercely. “If we
are raided upon here, shall you fight for or against
us?” she asked. “Let us know what to expect.”</p>

<p>“Lettice!” he exclaimed. “How can you ask such
a question? I will defend you to the last drop of
blood, but I hope there will arise no such emergency.”</p>

<p>Lettice gave him a lovely smile. “I almost wish
there would,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“Why such a wish?”</p>

<p>“Because you would then have an opportunity of
proving yourself a true American.”</p>

<p>He bit his lip and made no reply for a moment;
then he said, “I think there is no one, whatever his
views, who would not be ready to defend those he
loves, should they be in danger, but I think we have
no cause for alarm; non-combatants will be shown
every courtesy, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“By whom? That pirate, that thief, that marauder,
Cockburn?”</p>

<p>“Sh!” exclaimed Mrs. Tom Hopkins, hearing the
words. “Even walls have ears. We must be discreet,
Lettice.”</p>

<p>“Discreet!” began Lettice, passionately, but the
distant sound of great guns came upon their ears,
and the words died upon her lips.</p>

<p>It was a day of dread and great gloom which no
effort could dispel. They sat waiting, they knew
not for what, till at last Rhoda cried: “Here comes
a messenger riding hard. Go out, Robert, and see
if he brings news.”</p>

<p>Not only Robert, but all of them, hastened to
meet the newcomer, Betty and Lettice fairly outstripping
the others. It was young Birket Dean.
He looked tired and travel-worn, but he cried triumphantly:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>“All safe, Mrs. Hopkins! Our men had
to beat a retreat, but not before they had made the
enemy taste of their shot. We didn’t lose a man,
but there were several killed and wounded on the
other side, and more than one deserted. Every one
thinks that St. Michael’s is threatened, and Talbot
County is up in arms. I must ride on and tell them
at home of what has happened. I promised William
I would stop by and tell you all how matters stood.
He says you’d better stay here for the present, for he
took it for granted I would find you all here together.”
And he galloped off, leaving them all with
a great weight removed.</p>

<p>The next news that came was that the little town
of St. Michael’s was in danger of an attack. It was
the place where nearly all the famous “Baltimore
Clippers” were built, and because of this it attracted
the attention of Cockburn, who intended destroying
the shipyards and the vessels then in course of construction.
But he met so valiant a resistance that
he finally withdrew, and although the houses in the
little town showed the effects of the shot, which flew
like hail, not one of the militia was hurt.</p>

<p>The next day Lettice and Betty returned to their
own home.</p>

<p>“You’d better not be too hasty in getting back,”
warned Aunt Martha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“I believe Aunt Martha is disappointed in not
having had a visit from Admiral Cockburn,” said
Lettice, laughing.</p>

<p>“Indeed, then, I am not!” returned the lady with
some asperity; “but I’ve an older head than yours,
miss, and I think I may consider that I have more
discretion.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Lettice nodded; then said saucily, “If
you should receive a call, send us word, and we’ll
come over and help you entertain your Britishers.”</p>

<p>“And you’d do it well,” said Mr. Clinton in a low
tone.</p>

<p>Lettice gave a toss of the head and sprang into
her saddle. For some reason she was not pleased
with this young gentleman this morning; he had
been far too cautious in showing her attentions, and
had been too evidently anxious that no one should
discern any difference in his manner toward the two
girls; and besides, Lettice resented his saying that it
would be as well that they should not take Rhoda
into their confidence, and yet she had several times
come upon the two in close conference, and once
had overheard Rhoda say, “I will see that the matter
is kept a secret, but we must be very cautious.”
So Lettice, with a feeling that she could not quite
trust him, and that he might be playing a double<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
part, was most cool toward him, and eagerly seconded
her sister Betty’s proposition to go.</p>

<p>It was a few days later that William and James
returned. They came galloping in one evening full
of accounts of their skirmishes.</p>

<p>“It’s a great life,” said Jamie; “but I mean to
join Barney. We don’t get enough service here on
shore, and on sea they are always popping at each
other.”</p>

<p>“Then I needn’t return you the packet you gave
into my keeping,” Lettice said.</p>

<p>James smiled. “No, keep it safe, and if I want it
when the war is over, I will ask you for it, and if I
fall, bestow it as I directed you.”</p>

<p>“Lettice,” her brother William’s voice broke in,
“where are those papers? Are they safely hidden?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hid them with my own hands,” she
replied.</p>

<p>“I shall want them soon.”</p>

<p>“To-night?”</p>

<p>“Hardly, I think. I will let you know if I require
them; but they must be sent off the first
opportunity, for there are government secrets among
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, really? I am glad they are out of my hands,
then. Who is coming? I hear the clatter of horses
on the walk.”</p>

<p>William arose and went down the steps, and Lettice
heard him say: “Ah, General, welcome, right
welcome. Good evening, Tyler. Glad to meet you,
Mr. Baldwin. Come in, gentlemen, and let me
present you to the ladies.” And Lettice was soon
in the presence of the veteran, General Benson, Captain
Dodson, her old friend, Tyler Baldwin, and,
whom but the young naval officer, Ellicott Baldwin,
of whom Tyler had spoken to her, and whom she
well remembered.</p>

<p>“A fortunate circumstance it was which led me
to my cousin’s this week,” said the young man, who
bowed low before Lettice. “I trust you remember
me, for I have never forgotten you.”</p>

<p>Lettice blushed and dropped her eyes. “I was
very bold,” she murmured; “but I was so excited
that I forgot I was speaking to a stranger.”</p>

<p>“Not bold,” the young man hastened to say. “It
was but the charming naturalness of a child; the
spontaneity of trusting youth. You cannot think I
had feelings other than those of admiration for your
ingenuous words, and I have ever since desired an
opportunity of meeting you again. May I tell you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>how I happen to be here? Shall we sit here?” He
led her to a corner of the wide piazza, and seated
himself by her side. “The general and Captain
Dodson were coming this way to get some papers
which I am to deliver at Washington, to which place
I am to start by daybreak. They have been having
a lively time at St. Michael’s, as you probably
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have heard of it; but those papers—they
must be the ones my brother was just speaking
about, and I shall have to go and get them at once,
for it is I who know where they are hidden. I will
have to ask James to go with me.”</p>

<p>“Are they within doors?”</p>

<p>“No, they are down yonder.” She made a movement
of the hand in the direction of the graveyard.</p>

<p>“May I not accompany you? Your brother seems
occupied at this moment.”</p>

<p>“I do not object, if you are willing to help with
the digging.”</p>

<p>“Will I not be? Try me. I shall like the fun, I
assure you.”</p>

<p>“Then we will go at once. I will get a spade as
we go along. Are you afraid of haunts?”</p>

<p>“Not I. And it is moonlight and not midnight,
so I fancy we are safe from evil charms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps you have a rabbit foot.”</p>

<p>“No; nor any charm, except such as is possessed
by my companion, whose youth and beauty should be
sufficient to protect me from all malign influences.”
They sauntered down the moonlit garden path.
Sweet clove pinks and August lilies freighted the
air with their heavy perfume. Lettice remembered
that night, not so long ago, when she and Robert
had felt the spell of the moonlight, and when she
had almost—She drew a sigh which her companion
noted. “Does anything trouble you?” he asked
gently.</p>

<p>“No; it was only that I suddenly remembered
something. See, here by this footstone is the place.
The soil is light, and the box is not very deeply
placed. I think we can soon reach it.” She knelt
down on the grass and began to brush away some
of the loose leaves and sticks.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin struck his spade into the dry soil,
throwing out the earth deftly and easily. He had
been digging for some minutes when Lettice exclaimed:
“Surely, that should be far enough. Haven’t
you struck the box yet?”</p>

<p>“No; I seem to come upon nothing harder than
the earth.”</p>

<p>She peered over into the hole, resting one hand
upon the footstone. Then she exclaimed in an agitated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
tone, “That is much deeper than I dug, and
nothing is there!”</p>

<p>“Are you quite sure this is the exact spot?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very sure—exactly on a line with the footstone,
and a little to the right. Oh, no, I could not
possibly be mistaken, for there is not room on the
other side, you see. There is some mystery here.”
She took the spade and began to feel around with it.
“It is gone!” she exclaimed. “Some one has stolen
it away. I am as sure as of my existence that it has
been stolen away.”</p>

<p>“I will dig a little further, and more to the right;
you may have gone deeper than you thought.” He
threw out a few more spadefuls of earth, but discovered
nothing. “There is no box here,” he said at
last. “Who could have taken it?”</p>

<p>Lettice was silent a moment; then she said in
a tense way, “I think I know. The deceitful
wretch! The cowardly spy! I will denounce him
before the world.”</p>

<p>At this very moment a shadow fell upon the white
footstone. Lettice turned quickly—Robert Clinton
stood before them. “There he is!” she cried.
“That is he, the spy! No one else saw me, and I
do not know how long he may have been watching
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” cried Robert. “Lettice,
what do you mean? Of what do you accuse me?
A spy? I? Is it possible—”</p>

<p>“It is possible that I have learned the value of
fair words alone,” she returned scornfully. “I understand
many things now. I understand your confidences
with those who, like you, would be willing
to play into the hands of our country’s enemies.
Yes, I believe you are a spy.”</p>

<p>The young man turned to Mr. Baldwin, who, leaning
upon his spade, regarded the two. “Sir,” said
Robert, “will you tell me if this young lady is suddenly
crazed? Can you explain this to me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are very innocent!” Lettice broke in.
“Add deceit to deceit. Tell him, Mr. Baldwin,
since he is so innocent of the charge. Refresh his
memory.”</p>

<p>“Miss Hopkins secreted some valuables in this
place,” Mr. Baldwin said, turning to Robert. “We
came down here to unearth them, and we find them
gone.”</p>

<p>“And you charge me with taking them! Lettice,
you can do that? Great Heaven! what do I hear?
Lettice, you are but joking. You do not really mean
it. This is but one of your tricks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“I wish to Heaven it were so, sir. For my part,
if you have taken the box to plague me, it is a sorry
joke; but return the papers quickly, I beg of you,
and I will forgive you. Have you them? This is
no time for play; say quickly.”</p>

<p>“I have not,” he answered slowly. He was very
pale, and was trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>“You may not have them, but did you take
them?” Mr. Baldwin asked.</p>

<p>Robert whirled around upon him. “You dare ask
me that! And who are you, who take the right
to question me? I am not answerable to you, sir,
but you shall be answerable to me.” And, taking
a step forward, he gave the other a slap in the face.</p>

<p>From Lettice came a cry of dismay, and Mr. Baldwin,
with eyes flashing, said in a low, even voice: “I
will meet you, sir, when and where you please, as
soon as this charge made by Miss Hopkins is disproved.
At present I do not forget that we are in
the presence of a lady.”</p>

<p>“Lettice, Lettice, forgive me!” cried Robert.
But she gave him not so much as a look or a word.
She extended her hand to Mr. Baldwin. “Take me
to my brother,” she said. “I must tell him at once
of his loss.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin hesitated, and Lettice understood
that he would fain secure the man she had accused.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
“No, no,” she whispered, “do not arrest him. I
may have been too hasty. We have no proof as yet.
I beg of you, Mr. Baldwin, take no further steps till
we consult my brother. He—he may be innocent,
and—and—we have been friends.” Therefore,
leaving Robert standing wretched and alone, they
moved toward the house.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>An Interrupted Duel.</i></p>


<p>Pale and agitated, Lettice stood before the
company now gathered indoors. “It is
gone!” she whispered. “Gone!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked her brother.
“What is gone?”</p>

<p>“The box with the papers. I hid it by the footstone
where Theophilus Hopkins is buried, and just
now, when Mr. Baldwin and I went to get it, we
found nothing there. Some one has taken it.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea of who could have done it?”</p>

<p>Lettice twisted her fingers nervously, and gave
a quick distressed look toward Ellicott Baldwin, but
she made no answer.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea of who could have taken the
box?” General Benson asked. “Speak up, my
child. Remember that you are a loyal little girl, and
that it is for the good of your country that we discover
these papers. Beyond that, your brother’s
honor is involved, and you will place him in a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
embarrassing position if the papers fail to appear.
Did any one see you secrete these papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Lettice spoke so low that she could
scarcely be heard. Mr. Baldwin watched her
silently, but with an expression of deep sympathy.</p>

<p>“Will you tell us whom you suspect?” said her
brother, gently. “My little sister is so tender-hearted,
gentlemen, that she is loath to divulge the
name of the culprit, if indeed she knows it. Suppose
we talk it over by ourselves, little sister, if these
gentlemen will excuse us.” And putting his arm
around her, he led her from the room.</p>

<p>When they were alone she put her head down
on his shoulder and wept silently. “I don’t want
to tell, brother,” she said, when she had become
more composed. “I was very angry at first, but I
don’t want to get any one into trouble, and of course
I have no proof; I only suspect. But one person
saw me as I was covering up the box, and—Oh,
if I could only get the papers back, would I need
to tell?”</p>

<p>Her brother considered the question. “Perhaps
not. It would depend upon the person. If a dangerous
enemy were working us harm, you would
want him to be put where he could do us no injury,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“If that could be managed? If he should leave
the country?” said Lettice, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I cannot promise what leniency would be shown;
but if you can recover the papers and will tell whom
you suspect, I will do my best to see that nothing
shall be done without full proof of treachery.”</p>

<p>“Then if I can get the papers, and I promise to
tell you why they were taken, will that do?”</p>

<p>“So far as you are concerned, yes, I think it will.
Wait here and I will confer with the general.”</p>

<p>But her brother had no sooner left the room than
Lettice flew out by the back way, ran to the stable,
flung the saddle on her horse, and was off like a shot.
She would take no risks. Down the road she galloped,
and dashed up before the porch where Rhoda
was sitting alone.</p>

<p>“Lettice!” cried Rhoda, coming hastily forward,
“what are you doing here? Is there no one with
you? Have you brought bad news?”</p>

<p>Lettice slipped down from her horse, twisted the
bridle through the ring of the hitching-post, and
ran up the steps. “Are you alone, I ask in turn?”</p>

<p>“Yes. What is it? You are so agitated. Has
anything happened to—anybody?”</p>

<p>Lettice did not heed the eagerness of the question
nor the sudden pause before the last word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
“I am alone, yes. And something has happened.
No, no one is hurt, but some valuable papers have
been stolen. Do you know anything about it?”</p>

<p>“I? What should I know?” Rhoda drew herself
up, and held her head high.</p>

<p>“I overheard you talking one day to Mr. Robert
Clinton, and you said things which made me suspect
that you might try to help the enemy, if you
had a chance. And——Oh, Rhoda, never mind if
I do seem to accuse you! it is to save Mr. Clinton.
If you have any love for him or for me, tell me
truly, do you know anything about the papers?”</p>

<p>“I know nothing of any papers in which you
could possibly be concerned,” she replied coldly.
“Tell me your story more clearly.”</p>

<p>Lettice tried to do so, ending with, “If you have
not been concerned in the matter, he must have
done it entirely of his own accord.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that either of us would so
degrade ourselves as to stoop to theft?” returned
Rhoda, frigidly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I can’t tell. I am so distracted
that I hardly know what I do think. I know you
are not friendly to our cause, and that in war it is
not thought wrong to avail one’s self of all sorts
of methods to carry out an intention. Oh, Rhoda!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
if I do not recover the papers, they will make me
tell whom I suspect, and he will be arrested and
perhaps shot for a spy.”</p>

<p>“Sh! sh! Aunt Martha may hear.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“Gone to bed with a sick headache. It was
warm, and I did not care to go so early.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do? What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Do you care so much for Robert Clinton’s
safety?”</p>

<p>“I care! Of course I do. I don’t know whether
much or little. One would rather one’s friends
should be safe. I denounced him to his face for
a spy, and if it is true that he is one, I despise
him, but I do not want him taken and hung. Oh,
Rhoda, will you warn him? And, oh, those papers!
What can I do? I don’t know which way to turn.”</p>

<p>“Robert will tell me the truth,” said Rhoda,
after a moment’s thought; “I am sure he will.”</p>

<p>“And will you try to get the papers back again?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I am quite convinced that he did not
take them.”</p>

<p>“Who, then? No one else saw me.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I know that he did see me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“But you cannot swear that another was not
peeping, so I think you should give him the benefit
of the doubt.”</p>

<p>“I cannot help my suspicions, knowing his devotion
to his party.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he is not a traitor to his country, and
does not love her enemies any more than you do.”</p>

<p>“And I have given my word that I would tell
the name of the one I suspect. Please, Rhoda,
get him away if you can, but do not tell him that
I begged it of you. Promise me that.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best. It is a great pity that you
were not more cautious. Are you going back to-night?
Must you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must. I am not afraid.”</p>

<p>“No one knew of your coming?”</p>

<p>“No, I sneaked out, and shall probably be well
scolded for it. And what excuse can I make?”</p>

<p>“You are all well?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You have not seen Jamie yet, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“He has just come from down the country, and
to-night had to remain at home to help entertain
this array of soldiers I left there. You will see
him to-morrow, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“You volunteer the information as if you thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>I had demanded it.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you demand it? There, Rhoda, I
will not tease you. You have been very sweet
and forbearing, and I thank you, and will thank
you still more if you can help to get this dreadful
matter righted.”</p>

<p>“One thing you have forgotten.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“Your companion, Mr. Baldwin. You say you
denounced Robert before him. What is to prevent
him from telling the whole thing?”</p>

<p>“True. I didn’t think of that; yet I don’t think
he will until I give him leave. But so much the
more need of a speedy warning. When Robert—Mr.
Clinton comes in, you will see to it that he is
on his guard. They may come after him at any
moment.”</p>

<p>“I will wait till he comes in. He should be
here by now.”</p>

<p>“And I must get off at once. I would not encounter
him for the world. Kiss me, Rhoda. I
never loved you half so well. You are a dear good
girl. I wish I were half so wise and discreet.”</p>

<p>Rhoda smiled, and gave her the asked-for kiss;
then Lettice again mounted her horse and turned
down the level road.</p>

<p>She had not travelled very far before she heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the hoofs of horses coming rapidly toward her. Suddenly
there was a pause in the advancing sound,
and she drew in her horse. In the moonlight she
could see the forms of two horsemen ahead of her.
She watched them for a few moments as they carried
on an excited conversation. Presently each
led his horse to one side and tied him to the
fence; then they stood apart in the middle of the
road. Again there seemed to be a heated discussion.
Lettice wondered what it was all about. She
longed, yet feared, to draw nearer; but at last her
curiosity overcame her fear, and she too led her
horse to the shadow of a tree, tied him, and crept
along by the fence till she came within hearing
distance. At this point she gave a quick exclamation
which nearly betrayed her to the two young
men, in whom she recognized Robert Clinton and
Ellicott Baldwin. She cowered close to the fence,
her heart beating very fast. She dreaded to advance
or retreat.</p>

<p>“I am at your service at any time and at any
place,” Mr. Baldwin was saying. “I will accept
any challenge sent in the regular way.”</p>

<p>“Now! I insist upon it now. If you refuse, I
shall deem you a coward and a braggart,” cried
Robert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>“Then,” returned the other, hastily, “choose
your position.”</p>

<p>At that moment Lettice arose to her feet. This
was a duel, she comprehended, and perhaps one
or the other would be killed. She ran forward
and held up her hand. “You should have
witnesses,” she said. “Here is one.” She
stood between them, looking from one to the
other.</p>

<p>The men were thunderstruck. “You, Miss Hopkins!
What are you doing here? I rode out to
find you,” Mr. Baldwin said, but Robert spoke
never a word.</p>

<p>“I beg of you to desist,” Lettice went on. “I
chanced to be coming this way. I have been to
the house of a sick relative and was on my way
home. This is our own ground, and I forbid you
to make it a place of bloodshed.”</p>

<p>“I bow to a lady’s decree,” Mr. Baldwin said,
returning his pistol to its place. “Why did you
give us the slip, Miss Hopkins? And what is
your desire concerning yonder gentleman? You
denounced him in my presence, and yet when
the moment came to declare his offence to your
brother, you ran away. As for me, my lips are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>sealed till you give me permission to speak.”</p>

<p>“I do not give you permission to do anything
but leave him and let his conscience be his accuser.”</p>

<p>“But who is to be responsible for his appearance
if we find he is guilty of the act for which you
denounced him?”</p>

<p>“I will be. We have been friends,” she said
softly, as she half turned to where Robert stood
with arms folded and eyes cast down. For an
instant Lettice’s heart melted within her, and she
took a step forward, but she retreated again to
Mr. Baldwin’s side.</p>

<p>“Take me home,” she said faintly, “and let
this affair be settled there. My horse is but a
few steps back.”</p>

<p>“I will bring him to you,” Mr. Baldwin said,
“and yes, I shall be glad to defer this. You
understand,” he said, turning to Robert, “I am
at your service when you will. This address will
always find me.” He handed out a card with an
elaborate bow. He stood evidently thinking deeply.
“If you are innocent, sir,” he went on to say,
“you will not be afraid to answer a few questions
should you be required to do so. If you are
guilty, you owe your escape from immediate arrest
to the good offices of this young lady. Whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
may be my own opinion, I owe you no more of
an apology than you do me, and in the interest
of my country I am bound to say that you are
free only through extreme tolerance.” And he
turned away.</p>

<p>Lettice and Robert stood facing each other.
“How could you? How could you?” Lettice
murmured. “This dark suspicion has blighted all
the memory of our happy hours.”</p>

<p>“This dark suspicion, indeed,” replied the young
man.</p>

<p>“And you will not clear yourself, will not tell
me?” she said eagerly. “But give up the papers,
and I will screen you and will think of you as
gently as I can.”</p>

<p>“I have said that I have no papers.”</p>

<p>Lettice wrung her hands. “O dear! O dear!
if you would but be candid and tell me, I could
help you, I could indeed. For the sake of our
past friendship, will you not tell me?”</p>

<p>He came to her side. “Lettice,” he began;
then dropping the hand he had taken, he turned
away. “’Twould be no use,” he said. “Farewell,
the dream is over. Tell your friend that I shall
not run away either from arrest or from him.”
And he sprang on his horse and disappeared into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the woods, leaving Lettice with her face buried
in her hands.</p>

<p>She brushed away her tears as Mr. Baldwin
approached, and stood ready to mount her horse
again. They were fairly on their way when he
spoke. “This is a hard ordeal for a young lady to
go through, Miss Hopkins, but I cannot leave the
subject just yet. You are very positive that my
late adversary, whose name, by the way, I do not
know, is the one who took the papers?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not certain. I only think so because
he saw me secure them, and because he is violently
opposed to the war, and belongs to the Peace party.
I know he has been very energetic in working for
his side.”</p>

<p>“It looks suspicious, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Yet it would be a shame to arrest a man,
unless we were sure.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so, too.”</p>

<p>“I think he should be given the benefit of the
doubt.”</p>

<p>“That is dangerous, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I would rather let a dozen guilty
ones go free than to cause an innocent person to
suffer misfortune.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“A very lovely way of thinking, but I fear few
offenders would come to justice if all agreed with
you. However, in this case we shall have to trust
to chance. Your gentleman was very eager for
a fight, which it would perhaps have been as well
to allow him. I do not feel comfortable over that
part of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I think it would have been terrible!
He has been a friend of ours; has been received
at our house on the most intimate terms. Suppose
he had fallen, or had caused your death; it would
have been dreadful! I should never have ceased to
reproach myself for having been the cause of it.”</p>

<p>“You are right. I should have remembered your
part in the matter. But this other affair of—What
did you say the gentleman’s name is?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say. He is Robert Clinton, a relative of
our former Vice-President of the same name. He
is from New York, and is a great friend of some
connections of ours.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must settle this affair of his before we
go home. They are waiting for your return. You
can imagine your brother is in something of an
awkward position; the papers gone, and you gone.
It would simplify matters if we could have returned
with a prisoner. I fear Mr. Clinton will be beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>our reach by to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“He bade me say to you that he would not run
away from either you or the authorities, but if he
should, and if at last he is proved innocent, we will
both be glad.”</p>

<p>“In that case, yes. You do not seem to be so
enraged against him as at first.”</p>

<p>“No, I was truly angry. I always fly off like
that and regret it afterward. I have had time for
reflection, and I needed it. I spoke too impulsively.
Think what a dreadful dreadful state of affairs I have
stirred up by my quick tongue!”</p>

<p>“It was natural that you should speak in the
excitement of the moment. Where does this turning
take us?”</p>

<p>“Around by the bay.”</p>

<p>“Shall we take it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like. It is not quite so near a
way.”</p>

<p>She had hardly spoken the words before three men
sprang out from a fence corner. One snatched
Lettice’s bridle; two more dragged Mr. Baldwin
down from his horse. “I’ll take the girl, pretty
creature that she is,” cried the first, “and you can
have the Yankee.”</p>

<p>“Save me! Oh, save me! Let me go!” shrieked
Lettice. But the captor only laughed, and catching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
her around the waist, he pulled her down beside him,
while a terrible tussle went on between the other two
men and their prisoner, who fought like a tiger, and
finally managed to secure his pistol. A shot rang
out on the air, and one man fell. The one by Lattice’s
side sprang forward. “Poor old Jerry, are
you done for?” he cried, as he leaned forward.</p>

<p>Like a flash Lettice sprang up. At her feet lay
the man’s pistol which he had dropped. The girl
picked it up. Providence had come to her rescue.
She raised the pistol, but almost immediately her
hand dropped to her side. She noted that the man
had lifted the head of his former companion to a
more comfortable position. To shoot him would be
murder, she reflected. She could not, no, she could
not. Yet her own life and Mr. Baldwin’s lay in the
balance. Now her adversary was about to rise.
The horror of what might come next rushed over
her, and she hesitated no longer, but darted forward,
and dealt the man a desperate blow on the head with
the butt of the pistol. He dropped heavily by the
side of his fallen comrade, and was very still. Had
she killed or only stunned him? She shuddered and
turned aside.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Baldwin and his opponent fought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>for their lives. Lettice’s friend had discharged the
last load from his pistol, and now it was a question
of which would prove the best man in a hand-to-hand
fight? Lettice watched them breathlessly. The
strength of one or the other must at last give out.
Suppose it should be her one dependence, this desperate
man who was giving his assailant no time for
anything but to attend to the matter in hand.
Breathlessly Lettice put into execution a plan. If
Mr. Baldwin could only hold out long enough, she
might save both herself and him. She quickly undid
the long silken scarf she wore, tied one end tightly
around the wrist of the man she had sent to the
ground, and then tied the other end to a little tree
under which they had been sitting. It was sufficiently
small for her to be able to make her tether
quite secure.</p>

<p>The man began to move slightly, and Lettice
realized that he was merely stunned by her blow.
Another moment and he might recover sufficiently
to add to the hopelessness of the situation. In the
distance there was a faint plash of oars; it might be
that those who approached would reënforce these
assailants. Her wits were sharpened by despair.
She leaned over and extricated the pistol from the
belt of the wounded man, and rushed to a safe distance
from her prisoner. If he had a knife it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
take him but a moment to cut his bonds as soon as
he should be aware of them. She must act quickly,
for the regular plash of the oars came nearer and
more near.</p>

<p>Ellicott Baldwin, still struggling desperately, heard
a cry, “Look out!” A shot whizzed through the
air, and his adversary loosened his hold, and in a
second was felled to the earth. Lettice’s pistol had
done good service. She had wounded the man in the
ankle, for she had purposely fired low. “Here,
here,” she cried, thrusting the second pistol into Mr.
Baldwin’s hand, and he, with one dazed look, rushed
to where she stood.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Escape.</i></p>


<p>Lettice ran desperately fast to gain her
horse, but for a moment it seemed that all
were lost, for the sound of oars had ceased, and
instead, shouts were heard; an approaching party
of men answered their comrades, who, worsted by
a girl’s stratagem, would stand at nothing. It
took but a few minutes for Lettice’s captive to
free himself, and his first movement was toward
the girl. He was in a fury. One sweep of his
sword, one shot from his pistol, and their chances
were gone.</p>

<p>Ellicott Baldwin, between his set teeth, hissed,
“I will kill her and myself, too, before she shall
fall into their vile hands.” Suddenly, as if to
favor them, the moon disappeared behind a dense
cloud, and when it struggled forth again, the man
and the maid had vanished. Where? It seemed
as if the earth had swallowed them up. The
horses stood there, but not a sign of their riders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
On each side of the road lay level stretches overgrown
with weeds and bordered by straggling
blackberry bushes. Farther away, where a shallow
creek made up into the land, were trees growing
to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“Beat the bushes! Search everywhere!” cried
Lettice’s late captive. “I’ll have that girl if she’s
above ground. The little jade, to play me such a
trick!”</p>

<p>But not a sign of the fugitives could be found,
and after more than an hour’s fruitless search, the
men returned to their boats and to their station
on Kent Island.</p>

<p>Meantime, Lettice and her companion had made
their escape through the girl’s knowledge of the
country. She had whispered, “Over the fence!
Quick!” and herself had led the way by springing
into the bramble bushes on one side the road.
The thorns played havoc with her light gown, but
she tore herself free from them, ran along a few
steps, and leaped into a hollow filled with rubbish.
Here an old house had stood; now it was burnt
to the ground, and among and around its blackened
foundations grew tall weeds which completely
hid it from view. Lettice led the way,
and her companion followed blindly. At the rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the ground sloped gradually down to the creek, so
that by stooping low, as they made a pathway
through mullein, wild carrot, and ragweed, they
could not be seen by those nearer the road. Fortunately,
their followers did not strike upon the
tumble-down house, or it would not have been an
easy matter to reach the creek without being
seen.</p>

<p>Neither spoke till the silver gleam of the little
creek showed in the moonlight, now struggling
through the clouds.</p>

<p>“I am almost spent!” gasped Lettice; “but if
they have left the boat this side, we are safe.
Over yonder in the woods lives an old negro
woman. She is considered a real hoodoo by the
darkeys, but she is devoted to all our family, for she
belonged to my grandfather, who set her free, and
gave her this bit of land in those woods of his.”
She gave the information in detached sentences,
as she limped along the shores of the creek.</p>

<p>“You can scarcely walk,” said Mr. Baldwin.
“You have lamed yourself.”</p>

<p>“Have I? I was scarcely conscious of it. I
have stepped on many sharp stones, and these
thin slippers are not much protection. No, there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>is no boat,” she said, after some searching. “What
shall we do? We have made a short cut, but
those wretches may yet find us, if we keep this
side of the creek. Oh, I am afraid they will; I
am afraid!” She caught Mr. Baldwin’s arm with
a sudden fear.</p>

<p>“God forbid that they should find us!”</p>

<p>“You are hurt too. You are wounded, I know,
but do you think you could swim to that little
island in mid-stream? I would rather drown in
making the attempt than have them get me.”</p>

<p>“And I would rather you did. I think I can
make it, and I can help you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can swim, if I have the strength. I
but need that. Hark!”</p>

<p>There was a sound of voices and of crackling
branches among the trees behind them, and, with
one accord, they plunged into the stream, and
with slow, but sure progress, swimming, floating,
or making feeble strokes, managed to reach the
opposite shore, and when they drew themselves
up on the sands, their pursuers were parted from
them by a considerable stream of water.</p>

<p>Lettice dropped almost fainting on the ground,
and her companion was hardly less exhausted. It
would have been a very trifling feat for either one
of them, ordinarily, but the previous strain had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
nearly robbed them of their strength, and they sat
there for some moments, scarce able and scarce
daring to move.</p>

<p>“We are very wet,” said Mr. Baldwin at last.</p>

<p>Lettice gave a feebly hysterical laugh. “I am
very conscious of it. It is a warm night, but I
confess to feeling cooler than is agreeable. Do
you think they will attempt to cross?”</p>

<p>“No; and I am sure they did not discover us.
They did not dream of looking in this direction.”</p>

<p>“That good, kind moon,” said Lettice, raising
her face. “She was so good to screen us with
her clouds just at the right moment.”</p>

<p>“There are times when clouds can be of more
use than sunshine, it seems.”</p>

<p>“In this case, surely. Now I am thinking that
if it should come on to rain, we would be in a
sorry plight. We cannot be much wetter than we
are, but there would be no chance of getting dry
if it should rain. When we are rested, I think we
can find the boat we want to take us over to the
mainland. The water is quite shallow beyond, and
persons often ford the stream to this island, leave
their horses here and boat over to the shore we
have left. Since we found no boat there, I conclude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>it is here.”</p>

<p>“That is good news. We are not cast on a
desert island then.”</p>

<p>“No, as long as we can find the means to leave
it. I think the boat would be over in that direction,
among the bushes. We shall have to row
around the island to the other side. Do you suppose
we can do so without fear of being seen?”</p>

<p>“I think our pursuers have given up the hope of
finding us, for they seemed to be going back the
way they came. I think we are safe, but it will
not do to take any needless risk.”</p>

<p>“It was a party of Cockburn’s men from Kent
Island, I suppose. They are raiding around in every
direction. At St. Michael’s they have not dared to
use any lights, except such as they must have, for
months, and it is the same everywhere about. We
live in constant dread of them.” She shuddered
and hid her face in her hands, but in a moment
she looked up. “Mr. Baldwin,” she said, “I have
brought you into great danger which I might have
spared you if I had consented to do as my brother
wished. I must seem disloyal, as well as obstinate
and over impulsive.”</p>

<p>“None of those things. You have been brave,
and true to your compassionate nature. As for me,
save that you were in great danger, the experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
is one that I might meet at any time. I am not
seriously hurt; a cut or two; no bones broken. I
have come off well. Pray do not distress yourself
on my account. My sole concern is for you.”</p>

<p>“Shall we try to get across now? It must be
very late.”</p>

<p>“I think it is, and growing cloudier all the time.
Did you say the boat was this way? Sit still.
Please do not make any more effort than you need.
Those little feet have been too sorely tried already.”</p>

<p>The boat was found in its place, and they embarked
upon the little creek, by degrees making their way
around the island, and then across to the opposite
shore.</p>

<p>“I trust it is not far, for your sake,” said Mr.
Baldwin, seeing how utterly exhausted the girl was.</p>

<p>“No, it is but a little way.” Yet every step was
torture to the already bruised feet, and tears were
running down the girl’s cheeks when at last they
stopped at the door of old Hagar’s little hut.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin rapped sharply. “Who dar?” came
a startled response.</p>

<p>“It is I, Aunt Hagar; Lettice, Mars Jeems’s
Lettice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption">“<i>What yuh doin’ hyar dis time o’ night?</i>”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Law, chile! Fo’ de Lawd!” came the reply,
and in an instant there was a withdrawal of bolts
and bars, and the old woman’s head was thrust
out.</p>

<p>“What yuh doin’ hyar dis time o’ night, honey
chile?” she asked, peering out into the darkness.
“Huccome yuh lookin’ up ole Hagar? I specs yuh
in lub,” she chuckled; but when Lettice and her
companion stepped into the cabin and Aunt Hagar
had struck a light, she looked at the two in astonishment.
“Law, chile,” she exclaimed, “yuh look
lak ole rag-bag. What got yuh? Mos’ bar’ footy,
an’ all yo’ clo’es tattered an’ to’n; an’ who dis?”
She peered up into Mr. Baldwin’s face. “I knows
him. He one o’ de Bald’in tribe. Dat a Bald’in
nose. I know dat ef I see it in Jericho. What yuh
doin’ wif mah young miss out in de worl’ dis time
o’ night?” she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“We were at Uncle Tom’s, and were attacked by
a party of Britishers on our way home,” Lettice
told her.</p>

<p>“Some o’ dat mizzible gang from Kent Island,
I reckons.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we suppose so. Well, we had a desperate
time getting away from them. Mr. Baldwin fought—oh,
how he fought!”</p>

<p>“And you, Miss Hopkins, how well you did your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>part.”</p>

<p>“It was life or death, and we at last did escape,
but we have lost our horses, and are too footsore
and bruised and scared to go farther.”</p>

<p>“Ole Hagar fix yuh up. I has ’intment, yuh
knows I has; an’ I has yarbs; but, fo’ de Lawd, I’ll
cunjur dem Britishers, ef dey is a way to do it, dat
I will. Dere now, honey, let me wrop up dem po’
litty footies. Hm! Hm! dey is stone bruise, an’
dey is scratch, an’ dey is strain an’ sprain, an’ what
ain’ dey? But dis cyo’ ’em. Now lemme see what
young marster a-needin’. Hm! Hm! he slash an’
slit; swo’d cut on he shoulder. Huccome he fight
an’ swim an’ row, I dunno, wif all dese yer slashes,
an’ t’ars, an’ all dat. Yuh bofe has sholy been froo
de mill. I say yuh has.” And talking all the time,
the old woman managed to make her visitors really
comfortable, as she ministered to them with deft,
experienced fingers.</p>

<p>“Now, Aunt Hagar,” said Mr. Baldwin, when she
had put on her last bandage, “I will leave Miss
Lettice in your care, and I will go to her home
and report that she is safe. They will be very
anxious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are not fit to go any farther,”
Lettice protested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am. You do not know what a charm
Aunt Hagar has put into these ointments. Your
family will be in great distress of mind, and I think
it would be best that I should go and reassure
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, honey, he better go,” said Aunt Hagar,
from the corner where she was busying herself
with some mysterious mixture. “Mars Bald’in,
drink dis, honey, hit give yuh stren’th, an’ mek
yuh git over de groun’ lak a rabbit. Jess follow
de paf to de spring, den strike off to de lef’, an’
whenst yuh come to de hayricks by de right side
de road, yuh is jes back o’ Mars William’s barn.
Hit a roun’erbout way, but hit’s better dan crossin’
de water. I’ll look out fo’ Miss Letty. Yuh tell
’em Aunt Hagar got her, an’ dey satify she all
right. An’ tell ’em,” she went to the door and
spoke in a whisper, “tell ’em not to raise a cry
all roun’ de neighborhood dat she out dis-a-way.
Dey is folks dat love to talk, an’ I don’ want de
chile’s name to be made free wif, an’ have ’em say
she traipsin roun’ de country wif young men all
hours of de night. Yuh hyar me?”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, certainly, Aunt Hagar, and I
shall do my part in keeping the matter quiet. A
young lady’s name is too delicate a thing to be
bandied about by those who are merely curious.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
I will see you again soon, Aunt Hagar. I haven’t
thanked you half as I should for your kindness.”</p>

<p>Aunt Hagar beamed, and as she reëntered the
room and stood over Lettice, where she sat in a
low splint-bottomed chair, she said: “He blue blood.
I knows dat. Some folkses has money but dey
hasn’t nothin’ e’s. He got de name an’ de manners
of a gent’man.” She stroked Lettice’s hair with
her withered old hand. “Now, honey,” she went
on, “I gwine give yuh a drink o’ sumpin’ to put
yuh to sleep, an’ yuh ain’ gwine wake up no mo’
twel de sun three hours high; an’ I gwine put a
name in dis cup so yuh dreams gwine be sweet an’
pleasant. Yuh is had a bad ’sperience, an’ yuh
might have turr’ble dreams ef yuh didn’t have no
chawm ter stop ’em. Drink dis, honey, hit tas’ es
sweet an’ good, an’ won’ hu’t a kitten. I mek yo’
baid up nice an’ clean, an’ yuh sleep lak a baby.”</p>

<p>“But where will you sleep?” Lettice asked.</p>

<p>“I sleep whar I sleep. Yuh reckon I uses dat
baid? I sleeps whar I sleeps; in dis cheer, on de
flo’, anywhar I lak. Yuh don’ reckon I sleeps in
dat baid dese hot nights? No, ma’am, I sleeps
whar I sleeps.” And despite Lettice’s protests she
would have her take possession of the high four-posted
bed with its bright patchwork quilt, and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
fresh white sheets; and in a few minutes the
exhausted girl was fast asleep.</p>

<p>She awakened the next morning to hear the
patter of rain on the roof, and to see Aunt
Hagar crouching over a fire, giving her attention
to a fine pone browning in the bake kettle. There
was an odor of sizzling bacon, of coffee, and of some
herby mess which Lettice could not identify. She
sat up in bed, and called, “Aunt Hagar.”</p>

<p>The old woman arose with alacrity. “I ’lows
hit mos’ time fo’ yuh to wek up. I has yo’ brekfus
mos’ done, an’ yo’ clo’es is dry an’ ready fo’
yuh. Yo’ stockings is too raggety fo’ yuh to w’ar,
an’ yo’ purty frock ain’ nothin’ but strips an’
strings. Yuh has to w’ar hit though; hit clean.
An’ ’tain’ no matter ’bout de stockin’s, yuh ain’
gwine put yo’ footies to de groun’ fo’ a week; dat
I say.”</p>

<p>“But they feel much better; so much. And,
oh, Aunt Hagar, you must have been up very
early to have washed and ironed all my things.”</p>

<p>“I gits up when I ready. I nuvver has no
rug’lar time fo’ gittin’ up an’ gwine to baid,” she
explained; and then she helped Lettice on with
her clothes, after bringing her warm water in a tin
basin, and attending to her wants. Then she made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
ready the breakfast on a deal table to which
Lettice was assisted, after having been made to
drink a copious draught of herb tea.</p>

<p>“Mek yuh eat hearty, chile. Mek yuh feel nice,
an’ keep off de chills, an’ mek yuh rosy an’ purty.
Yuh doan’ want dem pale cheeks when Mars
Bald’in’ aroun’,” coaxingly said Aunt Hagar.</p>

<p>Lettice laughed, and, with a wry face, swallowed
the draught, and, to her surprise, she found herself
ready for a hearty breakfast, which seemed to
taste uncommonly good, for Aunt Hagar was a
famous cook and nurse, as she was a noted “conjur
woman.”</p>

<p>The girl had hardly finished her meal when
“rap-rap” came at the door, and the latch was
lifted to disclose her brother and her sister Betty,
with the carriage, pillows, wraps, and all such paraphernalia.
Sister Betty fell on Lettice’s neck,
kissing and compassionating her. “Oh, you dear
child, I was afraid you would be in a raging fever
this morning. Oh, you poor little thing, what a
dreadful, dreadful time you have had! Naughty
girl, to run away from your home. Come, William,
pick her up and carry her out to the carriage.
It is not raining so hard, but her poor
little tootsie-wootsies are all bound up, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
must be in a sorry plight, in spite of her brave
looks.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Hagar has been so good to me,” Lettice
told them. “She has made a new girl of me. I
am in rags, but they are clean ones, thanks to
Aunt Hagar. I feel wonderfully peart this morning,
after my woful adventures. And how is Mr.
Baldwin? I judge he reached you safely.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but in rather a sorry plight, for it was
raining hard when he arrived, and the extra effort
was none too good for him; but we have kept him
in bed, and we will cosset him, and he will soon
be well, I hope. He has come off worse than you,
for he has a high fever, and I was loath to leave
him; but Mammy is a good nurse, and I thought
she could do better for him than I.”</p>

<p>“He is a brave fellow,” William put in. “He
made little of his part in your affair, and much of
yours, but his condition shows that he fought manfully.
Ah, little sister, if you had but stayed at home.”</p>

<p>“Now, William, you shall not scold,” Betty interrupted.
“The child has suffered enough, and
she did what she thought was right, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“I did hope I could get the papers,” said Lettice,
wistfully, “and I thought the matter would be most
easily settled so, and I was afraid that it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
too late if I waited till morning, so I went, and it
was no use after all.”</p>

<p>“Yet, perhaps it was,” her brother said gravely,
“for the papers have come to light.”</p>

<p>Lettice opened her eyes wide. “And how were
they found?”</p>

<p>“There is the mystery. Lutie brought them to
me with a marvellous tale of their being handed
to her to be placed in my hands, and she either
pretended or she did not know who brought them.
I questioned her, but she stuttered and stammered,
and told about some one in a great cloak, and
whose face she did not see, and she declared she
was so mortal scared that she couldn’t have told
who it was, anyhow, and a lot of stuff from which
we could make neither head nor tail. But the
papers are safe, although no one knows but that
they have been copied. I would like to get at the
bottom of the matter.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can,” replied Lettice, thoughtfully.
“At all events, I am glad they have been returned.
And now we will go home.” So she was bundled
into the carriage, and reached home with a thankful
heart. But Aunt Hagar’s predictions came
true, for it was a week before she could put her
feet to the ground.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>Confidences.</i></p>


<p>The rôle of patient which was enforced upon
both Lettice and Mr. Baldwin was not altogether
disagreeable to the pair. A couple of days
was all the time that Mr. Baldwin would consent to
remain in bed, and by that Lettice, too, was downstairs,
looking, it is true, very pale and with blue
shadows under her eyes, but quite herself otherwise.
The knowledge of her night’s doings was kept a profound
secret from all but her immediate family,
although Aunt Martha and Rhoda were considered
sufficiently discreet to be intrusted with an account
of her adventures.</p>

<p>It was James who told Rhoda about it, when he
went over to make his farewells before going to join
Barney’s flotilla, for he declared that he was in no
mood for land service. “We can’t have every Tom,
Dick, and Harry discussing Letty’s doings,” he said.
“There are those just waiting for a chance to call
her light and unmaidenly, travelling around alone in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
these times; although we, who know her, can impute
it to nothing but pity and bravery. Besides, Cockburn
and his men have such a name, that but to mention
the fact of her having fallen into their hands,
would give rise to exaggerated reports.”</p>

<p>Rhoda nodded. “Yes, we who know her and
love her would best say nothing about it. Lettice is
a brave girl and a tender-hearted one, even if she
is a bit too impulsive.”</p>

<p>Jamie’s eyes beamed at this praise of his dearly
loved sister from one who was always chary of her
compliments; and when Rhoda expressed her determination
to go at once to see Lettice, he gladly
offered to be her escort. “I wish you were well out
of here and safe in Boston,” he said. “With that
terrible beast of a Cockburn infesting our shores,
and every man feeling it his duty to be off with the
militia, our homes are illy protected. Your father
should not allow you to remain here.”</p>

<p>Rhoda frowned, and half shut her eyes in a little
haughty way that she had. “My father does what
he thinks best. I do not dispute his judgment. He
does not know, or is not willing to believe, the state
of affairs down here.”</p>

<p>Jamie made no response although he thought,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>“Nothing to his credit that it is so.”</p>

<p>Lettice greeted Rhoda warmly. “It is good of
you to come over to see this battered-up piece of
humanity,” she said. “Am I not a decrepit?”
She thrust out one bandaged foot as she stood
holding to a chair.</p>

<p>“Are you then so lame?” Rhoda asked with
concern.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am rather used up by sprains and bruises,
but it is nothing serious, after all, and only demands
that I keep quiet.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” Rhoda said abruptly, as she
motioned Lettice to her place on the couch. And
Lettice gave her a detailed account of her adventures,
ending with, “And it was my very prettiest scarf,
the silk one with many colored stripes that Uncle
Tom brought me from Paris.”</p>

<p>“How can you think of such slight things when it
was all so serious?” Rhoda asked, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>Lettice laughed. “Because I am so shallow, I
suppose. I remember being thankful that I had
that particular piece of finery, because it was so
strong, and not like some of my others made of a
lighter and more gauzy material. You see how I
could let my thoughts run on dress, even in that
desperate hour. I tell you I am only a butterfly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>“But you are not. You weep like a baby over
the smallest thing, when it is weak and silly to do
so, and you prink and coquet and parade your
dress, but at heart you are brave and loyal, and
have the greatest amount of endurance. I cannot
make you out.”</p>

<p>“No more can I you. I am a piece of vanity,
and when there is anything to be gained by showing
a brave front I can do it well enough; at other
times I simply let myself go, and if I feel like crying
I cry, when there is anybody around to pet me
and make much of me, even if it is only Mammy.”
Then she suddenly became grave. “Did you know
that the papers were found? Or rather, they have
been returned.”</p>

<p>Rhoda started. “You don’t mean it!”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Who returned them?”</p>

<p>“My maid, Lutie.”</p>

<p>“Was she the thief?”</p>

<p>“No, I think,—I am quite positive, she was not.
She says they were given to her to deliver to my
brother.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“She does not tell. By the way, I promised my
brother William that I would try to fathom the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>matter. Rhoda, where is Mr. Clinton?”</p>

<p>Rhoda did not answer for a moment; then she
said: “You still suspect him? Do you mean me
to infer that you believe it was he who gave Lutie
the papers?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think. I would rather
fasten my suspicions on some one else, for more
reasons than one.”</p>

<p>“What reasons?”</p>

<p>“I would rather be sure the papers had not been
copied.”</p>

<p>“You believe he would do such a thing as that?
I do not. I have more faith in him than you, Lettice.”</p>

<p>“Yet you do not love him.”</p>

<p>“Have I said I do not?”</p>

<p>“No, but I know it. I know one cannot love
two men at the same time.”</p>

<p>“Lettice, you presume.”</p>

<p>“Do I? I don’t mean to; but—Ah well,
Rhoda, we are but girls, and we are on the lookout
for signs that escape others whose thoughts are not
on romances.”</p>

<p>“And you think you have read signs in me?
Am I such a telltale, then?”</p>

<p>“Far from it. You are unusually wary. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>Rhoda, do you know that Jamie leaves us to-day?”</p>

<p>The color mounted slowly to Rhoda’s face, tingeing
even her ears with red.</p>

<p>Lettice leaned over and said mockingly, as she
possessed herself of Rhoda’s hand, “A sign, Rhoda!
A sign! What does that blush mean?”</p>

<p>Rhoda bit her lip, but did not raise her eyes.</p>

<p>“Our bonny Jamie,” sighed Lettice. “Ah me, I
hope God will spare him. I hope, O I hope—Oh,
Rhoda, what if he should be going, never to
return.”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” cried Rhoda, in a sharp, quick voice.
And then she snatched her hand from Lettice and,
covering her face, sobbed in a convulsive, tearless
way.</p>

<p>“Rhoda, dear Rhoda,” cried Lettice. “What a
wicked girl I am! I did not mean to be cruel to
you. I should have had more consideration for
your feelings and have kept my fears to myself.”
She essayed to rise, but Rhoda motioned
her back. “Come here, then, and sit by me that
I may know that you forgive me,” she begged,
and Rhoda came. Lettice caressed and soothed
her so that in a few minutes she had regained her
composure.</p>

<p>“You asked about Robert,” she said. “He has
gone to Washington and vows he will never return.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
He left his address, should any one wish to know
of his whereabouts.”</p>

<p>“I am glad. I think that is best.”</p>

<p>Rhoda in her turn began to catechize. “Do you
love him, Lettice?”</p>

<p>“No, I can say truthfully that I do not. I was
beginning to, I think; but now, I am so racked
by doubt and mistrust that I have no room for
any other feeling. I do not want to love him.
This cloud would ever be rising between us.
I would grieve to have harm come to him, and
yet—”</p>

<p>“You would denounce him to his enemies?”</p>

<p>“If it would serve my country, yes. I could not
tell a lie for him.”</p>

<p>“Then you do not love him.”</p>

<p>“Could you tell an untruth for one you loved?”</p>

<p>Rhoda reflected. “I would not tell an untruth,
but I would believe in him though no one else
did, and I would not give up my belief while there
was a shadow of a chance that he was innocent.
And, in any event, I would be very sure before I
declared a person guilty who might be proved
innocent.”</p>

<p>“That is why I went to you the other night,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>replied Lettice. “And I did not denounce him
before any one but Mr. Baldwin, and that was in
the heat of my surprise and anger.”</p>

<p>“I know that. But we have been over this subject
before. He is gone and will not return. Let
us talk of something else. Your Mr. Baldwin,
where is he?”</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> Mr. Baldwin, as you are pleased to call him,
is here in the room across the hall. Would you
like to call on him?”</p>

<p>“Not I.”</p>

<p>“He is a brave young gentleman, and good to
look at.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is why you are not sure of your feeling
for Robert.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not,” returned Lettice, quickly. “And
that brings us back to the question we were discussing
a few minutes ago. Could a girl love two
men at once?”</p>

<p>Rhoda did not answer. She arose and said: “I
am staying too long. I must go back to Aunt
Martha. I promised her I would be back soon.
Your brother William has returned to his company?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he was at home but one day and could
remain no longer. With the British such near
neighbors, the militia must not be caught napping.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
The plantations are suffering for lack of attention,
but the men must fight though the crops fail in
consequence. Will you send Lutie to me, if you
see her on your way down? And do come soon
again.”</p>

<p>Rhoda promised and took her leave. In a few
minutes Lutie appeared. She had not shown her
usual devotion to her mistress during the last day
or two, and seemed anxious to efface herself, a proceeding
strictly the opposite to her usual one.</p>

<p>“You want me, Miss Letty?” she said as she
came in.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. I don’t want to be left up here all
alone. It seems to me, Lutie, you have a precious
lot of work downstairs, for you try to slip out
every chance you get.”</p>

<p>“Miss Rhoda, she hyar,” Lutie began protestingly.</p>

<p>“I know she was here, but she is not now. I
never thought you would neglect your own Miss
Letty, Lutie; especially when she is half sick, and
cannot get around without some one’s help.
Haven’t I always been good to you?”</p>

<p>“Yass, miss, yuh has indeed.”</p>

<p>“Then look here; tell me the truth. Now don’t
look so scared; I am not going to have you whipped.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
You know you never had a whipping in your life,
except from your own mammy. I want you to
tell me who gave you those papers to give to your
Marster William.”</p>

<p>Lutie began to sniffle. “’Deed, Miss Letty, I
didn’t see him. He have a cloak over him, an’ he
hide his face, an’ he a gre’t big man.”</p>

<p>“With fiery eyes like Napoleon Bonaparte that
you’re so afraid of? Now look here, is it any one
I know?”</p>

<p>“Yass, miss.” Lutie spoke in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>“Was it—now speak the truth—was it—”
Lettice looked cautiously around and lowered her
voice—“Mr. Clinton?”</p>

<p>Lutie writhed, and twisted, and looked every way
but at her mistress.</p>

<p>“Remember, you’ll be sorry if you don’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Miss Letty, what yuh gwine do ef I don’t
tell?” at last Lutie inquired in desperation.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do? Don’t you know
that old Aunt Hagar comes here every day to see
me? You know she is a cunjure woman, she’ll do
anything I ask her. You’d better look out.”</p>

<p>“’Deed an’ ’deed, Miss Letty,” wailed Lutie,
dropping on her knees, and rocking back and forth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>“I so skeered.”</p>

<p>“Of the Poly Bonypart man or the cunjure
woman? Which?”</p>

<p>“Bofe of ’em. An’ I skeered o’ dat Cockbu’n.
Jubal say he mos’ wuss’n Poly Bonypart.”</p>

<p>“Jubal does?”</p>

<p>“Yass’m. Oh, Miss Letty, don’ mek me tell.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Lettice rested her chin in her
hand and thoughtfully regarded the girl sobbing
at her feet. “Lutie,” she said after a pause,
“what did Jubal tell you about Cockburn and his
men?”</p>

<p>“He say,” Lutie replied, weeping copiously,
“he say ef I tells, ole Cockbu’n git me an’ mek
me dance er breakdown on hot coals; an’ he t’ar
out mah white teef an’ give ’em to he men to
shoot out o’ dey guns lak bullets; and he snatch
uvver scrap o’ wool off mah haid, fo’ to mek gun
wads outen; an’ he brek uvver bone in mah body,
an’ de Britishers rattle ’em when dey play dey
chunes ter march by.” Jubal could display a
delightfully vivid imagination when it served his
purpose.</p>

<p>“That certainly would be something terrible,”
Lettice commented gravely. “I don’t wonder you
are scared; but you know it would be nearly as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>bad if you wasted away,—hungry, and couldn’t
eat; thirsty, and couldn’t drink; and if your teeth
were to drop out one by one, and if your eyes
were to roll up into your head and never come
down again; and if those you love wouldn’t love
you, and if some one gave Jubal a charm so he’d
hate you. You know what a cunjure woman can
do.”</p>

<p>Lutie burst into loud wails. “Oh, Miss Letty!
Spare me, Lawd! Spare me! I a po’ mizzible sinner.
What shall I do? What shall I do? Oh, Miss
Letty, don’ let Aunt Hagar chawm Jubal, please,
miss. I die fo’ yuh. I serve yuh han’ an’ foot.”</p>

<p>“There, Lutie, there,” said Lettice, feeling that
in her application of Jubal’s methods she had gone
too far, “come here. Sit down there.” She put
her hand on the girl’s shoulder. “You want to
marry Jubal, I suppose. I knew he had been
philandering about you for some time. Are you
really fond of him?”</p>

<p>Lutie’s wails subsided into a sniffle. “Yass,
miss,” she answered meekly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I promise you that I will not let
any harm come to him or you through anything
you may tell me, if you tell the truth. And, moreover,
I’ll get Aunt Hagar to make you a luck-ball,
and I will not tell a living soul who it was that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
gave you the papers, as long as there is any danger
coming to either of you from it. But if you don’t
tell me the truth—then—”</p>

<p>Lutie’s sobs were again on the increase. “Oh-h,
Miss Letty, I sholy is hard pressed. I is skeert
one way by ole Cockbu’n an’ turrer by de cunjurin’.
I mos’ mo’ skeerter by de cunjurin’.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t tell your mistress, who has
always been good and kind to you, when you
know it would save her a great deal of trouble?
You won’t tell unless she threatens to punish you?
Ah, Lutie, think what I might do to make you
tell, if I were a hard mistress.”</p>

<p>“Miss Letty, Miss Letty, ’deed, ma’am, I don’t
want to do yuh so mean. Yuh won’t let Jubal
come to no ha’m, will yuh, Miss Letty?”</p>

<p>“No, I promised you, so far as I have any
voice in it, I will not. Don’t make me repeat it,
you disrespectful girl.”</p>

<p>“Miss Letty, I so bothered in mah haid I fergits
mah manners,” said Lutie, humbly. “I knows
a lady lak yuh ain’ gwine tell me no story, an’
when yuh says nobody know, nobody ain’ gwine
know. Miss Letty,—hit were Jubal hisse’f.”
And again the girl lapsed into violent weeping,
and the rocking back and forth continued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>Lettice was very quiet for a moment. “There,
Lutie,” she then said, “you needn’t cry any more.
You are as safe as can be, and so is Jubal. I will
not tell on him, but I want you to tell me all
you know about it. Did any one give him the
papers to give to your Marster William?”</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, Miss Letty, he peepin’ froo de
bushes when yuh puts de box in de groun’, an’
he say he think dey is gol’ an’ silver derein, an’
he want git me one o’ dem carneely rings, an’ he
jes think he tek a little an’ nobody miss hit, an’
ef dey do, dey’ll think de Britishers done git hit;
den when he open de box an’ fin’ nothin’ but
dem papers in hit, he lay out fur to put hit back
agin, but he ain’ had no chanst lak he mean
ter do, an’ so he give hit ter me, an’ say I is ter
give hit ter Mars William an’ do lak he say, an’
I so do; an’ he say ef I tells, de Britishers is
sho’ to come after me, ’cause dey want dem
papers.”</p>

<p>“How did he know that?”</p>

<p>“He heahs yuh-alls talkin’ ’bout hit dat night
he waitin’ on de gin’ral in de gre’t hall. Yass,
miss, he say all dat.” Lutie was very quiet now,
and only her wet eyes showed recent weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“Very good,” said Lettice. “Of course Jubal
ought to be punished. He has caused more mischief
than he knows, and he is not half good
enough for you, Lutie; although, poor ignorant
boy, it was a temptation,” she added, half to herself.
“Now dry your eyes, Lutie, and go get
that pink muslin out of the closet. I am going
to give that to you because you told the truth.
I’m sorry I haven’t a ‘carneely’ ring, but there
is a string of blue beads in that box; you may
have those.”</p>

<p>Lutie fell on her knees and kissed her mistress’s
bandaged feet in her ecstasy at this deliverance
from despair and this elevation to heights
of bliss, and in a minute she was bearing off her
treasures, every white tooth gleaming, as she
viewed these darling possessions.</p>

<p>“I am bound to make no explanations,” said
Lettice to herself. “What a complication it is,
and how badly I have treated poor Robert. No
wonder he was so hurt and angry and indignant.
Alas, if I tell any one that he is innocent, I will
have to prove it, and that I have promised not
to do. I shall have to wait events, I suppose.
Brother William is away, and there is no one else
who will press inquiries. Yet, am I not bound to
clear Robert to Mr. Baldwin, and I can do nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
else than write to Washington to Robert himself.
Dear, dear, what a scrape I am in!”</p>

<p>At this moment Lutie reappeared with the message:
“Miss Letty, Miss Betty say is yuh able to
come down to supper? Mr. Bald’in, he comin’, an’
she say she wisht yuo’d mek yose’f ready, is yuh
able.”</p>

<p>“I am able, but some one will have to help me to
hobble. Go tell Miss Betty, and then come back
and dress me.” She felt a little flutter of excitement
at again meeting the companion of her late
adventures, and selected her dress with some care.
Yet she sighed once or twice. She had been very
unjust to Robert, and of course he could never forgive
her. Yes, it was as he had said; that dream
was over. Nevertheless, she had a little feeling of
resentment toward him because he had not assured
her of his innocence. “If he had not reproached
me, but had told me, I would have believed him,”
she told herself. She had been too hasty, she admitted,
but like many other persons, she did not
feel willing to exculpate the supposed offender from
all blame and to acknowledge herself in the wrong,
and her feeling of resentment in consequence almost
overcame her regrets.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3">“<i>Sorrow an’ Trouble.</i>”</p>


<p>The two who had lately been companions in
misery met each other, at the supper table,
for the first time since the evening of their perilous
experience. “This is but our third meeting,”
said Mr. Baldwin, “and how various the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“There is a mighty big difference between a ball-room,
Aunt Hagar’s cabin, and our present surroundings,”
Lettice returned. “We cannot complain of
monotony. How are you, Mr. Baldwin? Mammy
tells me your fever ran high, and no wonder; I have
felt like a rag, myself.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to good nursing I am much better, and
shall be able to proceed to Washington to-morrow,
I trust.”</p>

<p>“You are not well enough,” Mrs. Betty protested.
“We cannot let you go when you are but half
mended.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, but there is no word but duty to those who
have promised to serve their country,” replied the
young man.</p>

<p>“Yes, but one owes a duty to one’s self as well as
to one’s country,” Betty returned.</p>

<p>“Every man is needed. With so little success on
the frontier, reverses at sea, and this vandal, Cockburn,
ready to destroy and pillage along these shores,
it is every man’s duty to be at his post, if he is able
to get there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so,” Betty sighed. “That is
what William says. With his father and uncle on
the frontier, his brother gone to join Barney, and
with the plantations running to waste down here,
they all have no word but duty.”</p>

<p>“And that is right,” Lettice spoke up. “It is to
protect their women and their homes that they go.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin nodded with a pleased smile.
“After all that you have suffered, to hear you say
that, Miss Lettice, proves that you are very loyal.”</p>

<p>“I am the more so that I have suffered. The
worse we are treated the more eager we are for the
war to go on.”</p>

<p>“That is beginning to be the prevailing spirit.
But I wish I could know you safe in Baltimore. I
think it is very unsafe for ladies to be left unprotected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>when the enemy is so near.”</p>

<p>“And such an enemy!” cried Betty. “Then
don’t you think you ought to stay and protect us,
Mr. Baldwin?”</p>

<p>He laughed. “You make me choose my
words, and put me in the position of seeming
very ungallant. I must go. I cannot do otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I agree with you,” Lettice gave her opinion,
“and if I were a man I would go too.” And Betty
arising from the table, they adjourned to another
room, Lettice being carefully assisted by the young
man.</p>

<p>“Each moment I remain is dangerous,” he whispered,
“for each moment it becomes less my desire
to leave.” Lettice blushed, and while Betty went to
her baby, they two sat in a corner of the wide hall
and had a long talk. They had not many friends in
common, but they loved their country, and they had
struggled with a common foe; then no wonder they
were not long strangers.</p>

<p>“I have never asked you where your home is,”
said Lettice, to her companion. “You do not talk
like a Southerner, and yet you are Tyler’s cousin.
I do not seem to distinguish your native place by
your speech.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>“I am from Massachusetts,” he told her, “but I
am something of a cosmopolitan, as every one who
follows the sea must be.”</p>

<p>“From Massachusetts? I thought every one in
that state was dead set against the war.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not every one. To be sure, New Englanders,
as a rule, are against it; but if you should
investigate, you would find many gallant soldiers and
sailors hailing from our part of the country.”</p>

<p>“Have you always lived there?”</p>

<p>“Always. My father lived there all his life, and
my grandfather before him, and I am very proud of
my native city. Tyler Baldwin and I are second
cousins; his grandfather and mine were brothers,
and as I was for some time in Annapolis, near my
father’s kin, I came to know them quite well.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to find one New Englander so
fierce a fighter in this war. It doesn’t seem right
that when she did so much in the Revolution—not
that it was more than we did—but when she did so
much then, that she should be so dreadfully indifferent
now, when it is just as much a war for freedom.
I am afraid that, like our old cat there, New England
has grown fat and lazy in prosperity. I think I’ll
name that cat New England, for she has no special
name; Puss seems to be sufficient for her own uses.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin laughed, and they chatted on contentedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
till the big clock in the hall warned them
of the lateness of the hour, and, beyond that, Mammy
had been hovering around for some time, with uneasy
glances at her patient.</p>

<p>“I feel as if I had known you for years,” Lettice
said, as she bade the young man good night.</p>

<p>“If length of time be counted by the amount of
pleasure it brings, I have known you for years,” he
returned gallantly.</p>

<p>The next morning he took his leave, and the two
women, left alone with the servants, looked forward
with dread to what the days might bring them. But
before long their hearts were cheered by news from
the North; that news which, in the never-to-be-forgotten
words, “We have met the enemy and they
are ours,” announced Perry’s victory to a grateful
people. Report after report of victories at sea had
come, but none that matched in importance that
which was won by Perry on Lake Erie. All over
the country bells were set ringing, cities were illuminated,
toasts were drunk to the young hero, and
odes were addressed to him; and those who before
had felt very dubious, now began to place unlimited
faith in the success of the American side.</p>

<p>Even Aunt Martha and Rhoda rejoiced openly,
for the former still obstinately refused to leave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
plantation, and the latter felt it her “dooty” to remain
likewise. She was a very sweet and gentle
Rhoda these days, and Lettice grew more and more
fond of her.</p>

<p>Lettice, it may be said, was not long in recovering
her usual health and spirits. One of the first visits
she made was to Aunt Hagar. She bore her a gift
from Mr. Baldwin, and the old woman was greatly
puffed up by the possession of a five dollar gold piece.
She made mysterious incantations, and consulted teacups
and cards, and used other means of reading Lettice’s
fortune. The fair man and the dark man, and
the fair woman that came between, and the surprise
that was partly agreeable and partly disagreeable,
were all there, but the most impressive of all was a
prophecy which seemed greatly to disturb the old
woman herself.</p>

<p>“Sorrow an’ trouble,” she said, “to you an’ yo’
house. Law, honey, law, honey, I is sholy distu’bed
to see dat. From across water comes black death,
an’ here is weepin’ an’ wailin’ an’ gnashin’ of teef.
Dey is meetin’ an’ partin’, an’ ’live is daid, an’ daid
is ’live. Dat is de mos’ cur’os fortune I has fo’
many a day. I wisht I ain’ seen it, I sholy is. I
dat hu’t in mah min’ I can’t sleep dis night. What
dis? I lak to know who dat. Go long home, honey.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
I so ’stracted I dunno what I sayin’.” And after
Lettice left, until late in the night, the old woman
pored over her pack of cards, shaking her head and
muttering, “Sorrow an’ trouble.”</p>

<p>The next day came a messenger in the person of
a small, kinkey-headed darkey. “Mammy Hagar say
will Miss Letty come see her. She turr’ble sorry to
trouble her, an’ she ain’ meanin’ no disrespec’, but she
got sumpin’ to tell her, an’ please, miss, come by yo’sef.”</p>

<p>Lettice donned her cloak and hat and set off, wondering
what was meant by this. It was early afternoon,
and the scene was fair and peaceful. One
could scarce realize that war ravaged the land. She
sauntered along through the woods, stopping every
now and then to pick a leaf which had reddened
early, or to watch a partridge hurry to cover. At
Aunt Hagar’s door she knocked. The latch was
lifted, and the wrinkled face of the old woman appeared.
She whispered mysteriously, “Come in,
honey,” and shutting the door carefully, she beckoned
her visitor to one corner of the room which was
screened off by an old quilt. Here, on a rude pallet,
lay a man.</p>

<p>Lettice started back. “Who is it?” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>“Dat what I say.”</p>

<p>“Where did he come from?”</p>

<p>“He layin’ out in de holler o’ de ole house what
got burnted, an’ I gits him here, an’ he cl’ar outen
his haid an’ stupefy. He one o’ dem Britishers, yuh
reckon?”</p>

<p>Lettice observed him more closely; then she gave
an exclamation of surprise. “Why Aunt Hagar, it
is Pat—poor Patrick Flynn!”</p>

<p>“Is dat so? I says, ‘whar I see him befo?’ Dat
jes’ who.”</p>

<p>“But how did he get here?”</p>

<p>“I jes’ drug him along. I right spry yit, an’ I
git him a little way an’ den drap him an’ git mah
bref twel I gits him to de boat. I say ef he a fren’,
I boun’ to cyo’ him up, an’ ef he a Britisher—what
yuh reckon I do, Miss Letty?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Don’t let us talk of that. It
would be hard to decide. As it is, I am very glad
it is poor Patrick. He should be taken at once
to Aunt Martha’s—but no, he probably escaped
from some British ship, and was shot while trying
to get away. We shall have to keep him in hiding
till he gets well.”</p>

<p>“Das what I say, an’ dat why I ast yuh come
look at him. I say Miss Letty so sma’t she know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>ef he a Britisher, fo’ all dem clo’es he w’ars.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will get well,” said Lettice. “What
a joy it will be to his mother if he does. It is
just as well that she should not know that he is
here, for if he should not recover, she would have
the double grief of losing him. Take good care
of him, Aunt Hagar, and I will send over some
things for him from the house. I will tell Sister
Betty. Perhaps she will insist on having him
removed to our house, although I really think he
is much safer here;” a wise decision, as was proved
true before the week was out.</p>

<p>It was late one rainy evening that Rhoda and
Lettice were sitting in the open doorway, listening
to the patter of the rain on the leaves. “I
feel very dreary, and full of forebodings,” said
Lettice. “I suppose it is because the autumn is
so near. I always hate to see the summer go,
and I believe that somehow Aunt Hagar has
scared me into thinking something dreadful is
going to happen.”</p>

<p>“Something dreadful is happening all the time,”
Rhoda answered. “I certainly think that an ignorant
old woman’s vagaries have nothing to do with
it. I am not so superstitious.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not a descendant of a Salem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>witch,” returned Lettice, laughing.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am, and that perhaps is why I abhor
superstition,” Rhoda spoke in all seriousness. “One
of my ancestors was accused of witchcraft, but fortunately
the delusion ended before she was executed
by the fanatics who hounded the poor innocent
creatures to their death. Hark! What is that?”</p>

<p>There was a sound of running feet; of shots
fired; of sudden cries. The two girls clung close
together, and Betty hurried to the door, while the
house servants gathered around, quaking with fear.</p>

<p>Presently from out of the gloom a dark figure
staggered toward them and, stumbling, fell at their
feet; then another rushed past them into the
house. He blew out the candle Betty held and
disappeared. Outside was a clatter and a clamor.
A swearing, threatening band of redcoats surrounded
the house.</p>

<p>For a moment the three women stood transfixed
with horror: then Lettice sprang indoors and blew
a shrill whistle which brought from the quarters
those negroes who had not gone into hiding at the
approach of the soldiers. Their appearance added
to the rage of the enemy. The leader struck a
light, and taking the candle from Betty’s nerveless
hand he relighted it. “Aha, some pretty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>girls!” cried out one of the men behind him.
“We’ll find the vile deserter, and then we’ll have
some sport with the ladies, eh, boys? Here’s my
choice.” And he seized Rhoda, who shrank back
with a faint moan. This but added to the man’s
delight and drew her nearer. But at this moment
the prostrate man on the porch, who by painful
effort had dragged himself to the sill of the door,
feebly raised the pistol he held, fired, and Rhoda
was free to rush out of the open door into the
darkness.</p>

<p>Those inside were sobered down. “Here, men,
search the house,” said the leader, sternly. “Fire
on any one who dares to stand in the way.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do! What shall we do!” Lettice
moaned in despair. But Betty had rushed upstairs
to her baby, and Rhoda was not in sight. The
figure by the door had crawled out into the gloom
again. How many of the enemy might be outside
Lettice could not determine, and she stood
trembling, daring neither to leave the house nor
to follow the men who had gone to the upper
rooms.</p>

<p>Finally she ventured out upon the porch. Near
the door Rhoda crouched, and in her lap rested the
head of the wounded man whose shot had felled
her assailant. She was murmuring incoherent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
words. Lettice drew near. “Rhoda, Rhoda,”
she whispered, “who is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lettice! Oh, Lettice, he is dying!” she
cried in a shaken voice. “It is Jamie! Jamie!”</p>

<p>Lettice dropped on her knees by the side of
the dear lad who lay very still. Lettice lifted
his hand and held it between her own, her tears
falling fast. She did not heed the tread of the
men who returned from their fruitless search.
“The miserable wretch has escaped us somehow,”
as in a dream she heard one say. “This is the
second we have lost this week.” He leaned over
and touched Lettice’s cheek. “Get up here, girl.
I want to look at you,” he said.</p>

<p>Lettice, with streaming eyes arose and with
clasped hands approached the leader of the band.
“Sir, yonder dying man is my dearly loved brother,”
she said. “Will you not leave us alone with our
great sorrow? We would be but triste companions
for your men. Take what you will, but
leave us these last few moments sacred from intrusion.”</p>

<p>The man stood looking at her a moment; then
turned on his heel. “The presence of a lovely
female in distress was always too much for me,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>he muttered. “We will pursue our search further,
and perhaps will pay you a visit later. We will
respect your desire to be alone. We, too, have
lost a friend.” He nodded toward the hall where
his comrade lay.</p>

<p>“He has gone beyond our resentment,” said
Lettice, gently. “We will bury him in our own
graveyard, unless you wish to bear him away with
you.”</p>

<p>“No, he will rest as well in one spot as in
another,” returned the man. “We will continue
our duty and leave him to your kind offices.”</p>

<p>He then gathered his men about him and strode
away.</p>

<p>Betty had followed the searching party downstairs,
and now appeared with the candle. She
held it so its rays fell on Jamie’s white face.
“Jamie!” she cried. “Our Jamie! Oh, what
terrible thing is this?”</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and smiled to see Rhoda
bending over him. “I saved you, dear, didn’t I?”
he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, you saved me,” she controlled her voice
sufficiently to answer.</p>

<p>He let his gaze rest a moment upon her, and
then he looked at Lettice. “Kiss me, little sister,”
he said. She leaned over and kissed his pale lips.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
One of his hands stirred as if seeking something,
and Rhoda slipped her fingers in his. He gave
them a slightly perceptible pressure. His eyes,
large and imploring, searched her face. She understood
what he would ask, and she, too, leaned over
and kissed him solemnly, and into the searching
eyes crept a satisfied look.</p>

<p>“Can we not get him into the house?” said
Betty, in distress. “Is there nothing we can do?”
For answer there was a quiver of the lad’s eyelids,
one sigh, and then his young heart had ceased
to beat.</p>

<p>Down the road the British soldiers were disappearing.
The three women sat sobbing convulsively.
They had no thought for past or present danger,
nor for anything but the presence of this great
sorrow.</p>

<p>After a while one of the colored men stole up.
“Dey all gone, Miss Betty,” he said. As he spoke
from the house appeared before them another
figure, and some one dropped upon his knees and
covered his face with his hands. “Jamie, Jamie,
little brother!” he groaned. “Would to God I had
been the one!”</p>

<p>The startled women lifted their heads. “Brother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>Tom!” cried Lettice. “Oh, Brother Tom!” Then
Aunt Hagar’s words returned to her, and she repeated:
“‘The dead shall be alive, and the alive
shall be dead.’ Oh, Brother Tom, it is Jamie, our
Jamie!”</p>

<p>“Who lost his life in saving mine,” said the
young man. “Let us bear him indoors.” And
tenderly lifting their burden, they laid him in the
great hall.</p>

<p>Lettice felt that it was good to have this lost
brother to soothe and comfort her, albeit his return
brought no joy, for the shadow was too great. She
was confused and heart-broken, so that no explanations
were offered that night. Lettice had but
asked, “Are you safe here, Brother Tom?” and
he had replied: “Safer than elsewhere. They
have searched here once and have not found me;
they will not come again at once, and we shall
be gone before another day. I cannot leave you
here to be exposed to these dangers, little sister,
and we must get off to Baltimore as soon as ever
we can.”</p>

<p>Even the next day they asked no questions, for
in the evening, at sunset, they laid Jamie to rest in
the old graveyard, and in one corner they buried,
too, the British soldier who had met his death
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>through Jamie’s last effort for Rhoda. Friend
and foe, the service was read over them, and they
were left asleep, with all differences forever stilled.</p>

<p>Rhoda, in her self-control and reticence, gave
little evidence of what she felt, and it was only
when Lettice saw the anguish in her eyes that
she realized that Rhoda’s best love was buried
with Jamie; and when she returned to the house
she remembered the packet which Jamie had given
her. She followed Rhoda to her room to give it
to her. The girl was lying, face down, upon the
floor, in tearless grief. She did not hear Lettice’s
light tap at the door, nor did she heed her entrance.
“Jamie, oh, my darling!” she moaned. And Lettice,
with eyes overflowing, put her arms around her.
“Dear Rhoda,” she said, “he left something for
you.” And into her hand she gave the little
packet.</p>

<p>Rhoda’s cold fingers closed over it, and in a
minute she sat up. “Stay with me, Lettice,” she
begged. “We will open this together.” She
reverently undid the little box. On top lay a paper
on which was written: “For Rhoda, from one who
loved her with all his heart. God bless you and
keep you and make you happy, my darling. From
Jamie.” There was a case underneath. Rhoda
lifted it out and touched the spring, to disclose a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
lock of curly auburn hair and a miniature of Jamie.
As his bonny face smiled up at her, Rhoda gave
a great cry and shed the first tears her eyes had
known since that moment when his spirit passed.</p>

<p>“It is so like, so like,” she murmured. “How
I shall treasure it, Lettice. My bonny Jamie, how
shall I live through the long years? And you
will never know how much I loved you.”</p>

<p>“He knows now,” said Lettice, softly. And she
went out, leaving Rhoda more comforted by this
than by anything that could have come to her.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>Jubal.</i></p>


<p>The next day the two girls parted, not to meet
again for many a long day. Aunt Martha had
received a letter from her husband, in which he
begged that she would leave the plantation and return
to Baltimore. He had heard of the depredations along
the Chesapeake, and was filled with anxiety for her.
Therefore she concluded to follow his advice, and
made ready to go back to her city home. Betty, likewise,
vowed that she could not remain, for these late
scenes had completely unnerved her, and she decided
to pack up and go to her father in Kent County, and
Lettice agreed to go with her, after receiving the
approval of her brother Tom as to the step.</p>

<p>“I will hunt up William,” he said, “and will report
to him of your movements.”</p>

<p>Before he left, he told them of how he had been
picked up by a British vessel, on that day, so long
ago, when he had fallen overboard, and how he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
fallen into the captain’s humor when he pretended to
believe he was one of his own men, and he had joined
the service, determining to escape when he had
enough of it. Later on he found himself on board a
vessel on which were his old acquaintances, Pat
Flynn and Johnny Carter. The three put their heads
together and laid plans by which they might manage
to get away. Tom was the first to make the attempt,
and one dark night dropped overboard. He had not
given his true name to any one during all this time,
nor did he do so when he was picked up by an American
vessel.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget,” he said, “how bravely a
young lieutenant stood by me. He was taking in a
prize when he sent out a boat to pick me up, and
after I told him my story, he swore he would never
give me up, though he died for it. He had a chance
to prove his words not long after, and stand by me
he did, to such an extent that a fight was on before I
knew it, and we carried in two prizes instead of one.
But as ill luck would have it, on my way home I was
taken prisoner just outside our own bay, for the vessel
on which I was returning had a little set-to with
a British cruiser, and I was nabbed and brought in.
But home was too near for me not to make desperate
efforts to get to it, and so I did, with what result you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
see. I hope Pat got away. Poor fellow, he was bent
on it, if chance offered.”</p>

<p>“He did then,” Lettice was able to tell him, and
she gave an account of him; then begged Tom to
continue his story.</p>

<p>“As I was making for shore,” he went on, “swimming
up the little creek I knew so well, whom should I
see at the old landing where we always kept the boat,
but some one else getting ready to row across; and
who should it be but Jamie. I did not know him, for
he was only a little chap when I last saw him, but he
recognized me, and was overjoyed to see me, in spite
of all my misdeeds, and we started off, when pell-mell
came a party of British after me. The best thing
we could do was to try to cut across and reach home
the long way, instead of coming over the creek. So
we landed, and at first got along very well, but the
wretches, piloted by some one who knew the way,
caught sight of us just before we reached here.
Jamie kept encouraging me, and said if we could but
get to the house it would be all right, and he reminded
me of our old hiding-place; but I tripped and fell
over the roots of the old locust tree, and Jamie,
never thinking of saving himself, stopped to help me
up. I cried out to him to go on, but he would not,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>and he was hit just as we reached the steps. I didn’t
even know it, for he called out, ‘I’m right behind
you, Tom’, and—” he stopped short and could not
go on. Lettice was sobbing, her face against her
brother’s broad shoulder.</p>

<p>Betty’s tears were falling fast, and she said
unsteadily, “Greater love hath no man than this.”</p>

<p>“Go on, Tom,” said Lettice. “Our dear one is
safe; oh, so safe.”</p>

<p>“God grant that when my time comes, I shall
not forget his example!” said Tom, brokenly. He
was silent for a moment, and then went on with
his story. “I had the wit to blow out the candle,
and I ran upstairs to the little closet under the
eaves at the end of the garret, that was struck by
lightning and boarded up afterward; you know the
place, and how it can be reached from the roof
by going down the scuttle on that side.”</p>

<p>“They hunted through the garret well,” said
Betty, “but there was so much piled up this side
that they never dreamed there could be any one
beyond. I had forgotten the place myself, though
William has often told me how you boys used to
hide there and make a playroom of that end of
the garret.”</p>

<p>“Jamie had suggested it as a good place, and
told me I would find it just the same, so I concealed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
myself till, through the chinks, I saw the
rascals go off, and then as Jamie had not come,
I was seized with a mighty fear for him, and
could not stay. It will be sad news for our
father.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but there will be good news for him,
too,” Lettice tried to comfort him by saying.
“We have you again.”</p>

<p>A little later, with a quiet good-by to her
brother, she parted from him and made ready for
her own departure. Lutie, her unwilling helper,
dawdled so persistently over the packing that
Lettice at last spoke up sharply. “We’ll never
get ready at this rate. I’ll leave you here to be
gobbled up by the British if you don’t move faster,
Lutie.” But this threat did not seem to have
the desired effect, for, though Lutie hung her
head, she looked more cheerful, and Lettice, bending
down, regarded her searchingly. “I believe
you want to stay,” she said severely. “I believe
you want to desert your mistress, Lutie.”</p>

<p>Lutie’s head hung still lower. “No, ma’am,
Miss Letty, ’deed I doesn’t; but I wisht yuh
wa’nt gwine.”</p>

<p>“Why? You are so scared of Cockburn and his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>men, and yet, now there is danger, you don’t want
to leave. Ah, I see; it is Jubal. And what does
Jubal say, pray?”</p>

<p>“He say dey ain’ gwine tech me, but dey gwine
run yuh-alls off. An’ he say ef he’d a knowed
hit were Mars Torm what runned f’om ’em, he’d
foun’ a way ter git him home better’n de way he
come.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Lettice was thoughtful. “Lutie,”
she cried suddenly, “I believe it was Jubal who
informed on him. It was Jubal who showed those
wretches the short way here, and he had caused
your dear Marster Jamie’s death. Oh, the wretch!
Why did I spare him?”</p>

<p>“’Deed, Miss Letty, he ain’t gwine hu’t a hair o’
yo’ haid; Jubal ain’. He turr’ble bad over losin’
Mars Jeems; he weep, an’ mo’n, an’ go on; ’deed
he do, Miss Letty. He sutt’nly fon’ o’ Mars
Jeems. Ev’ybody love him, Miss Letty, an’ Jubal
nuvver do him no ha’m, please, Miss Letty.”</p>

<p>“Hush, let me think.” She sat with her cheek
pensively resting in her hand, thinking deeply.
All at once there was heard a clatter below.
“Hark!” she cried, starting up. “See what that
is, Lutie.”</p>

<p>A sharp rap on the door interrupted her, and
without waiting a response the room was entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
by two or three British soldiers. “We demand
that you give up the deserter who has taken
refuge here,” said the foremost one.</p>

<p>“No deserter is here,” replied Lettice, steadily.</p>

<p>“I must beg leave to contradict you,” said the
man, looking admiringly at the girl so fair and
slight in her black frock.</p>

<p>“I speak the truth,” she returned. “You are
at liberty to search the premises. Look for yourselves.”</p>

<p>“We must press you and your maid into our
service,” said the man. “Here, you wench,” he
turned to Lutie, “go with your mistress and show
us where the man is hidden.” He drew his pistol
and touched the cold muzzle to Lutie’s temple.
The girl gave a stifled scream, and Lettice grew
paler.</p>

<p>“You may use whatever force you choose, but
you will not succeed in finding any one hidden
here,” she said. “I have three brothers; one left
us something like a week ago—”</p>

<p>“To join your wretched militia, I suppose, and
that makes this place our property. We are ordered
to spare only non-combatants and their possessions.
Help yourselves, boys. Well, miss, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>others, where are they?”</p>

<p>“My eldest brother has gone to join the younger.”</p>

<p>“Then it is the third we want. Hand him over.
Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Lying in our little graveyard,” Lettice answered
brokenly, “slain by one of your bullets. He who
had never done wrong to friend or enemy lies
there.” She covered her face with her hands, and
sobs shook her.</p>

<p>The man was silent for a moment; then he said
more gently: “My dear young lady, we had what
we supposed to be reliable information on the subject
of our deserter. One of your own men told
us we should find him here.”</p>

<p>Lutie gave a smothered exclamation, and Lettice,
dropping her hands from her tear-stained face, said,
“Could you point him out to me?” She would
have her brother Tom get as far on his way as
possible; it was policy to detain these men, and
she would know who was this snake in the grass.</p>

<p>“Yes; I think there would be no difficulty
in identifying him,” replied the man. “Go out,
Clarke, and see if you can find the fellow. Bring
him in here, and see what he will say when confronted
by his mistress. If the fellow lied—”
The click of a trigger told what would happen.</p>

<p>Lettice with bowed head waited results. Lutie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
trembling in every limb, cast scared glances at
her mistress.</p>

<p>In a few minutes was heard the tread of the
returning soldier, and Lutie fell on her knees,
clasping Lettice’s skirt. “Spare him, Miss Letty,
spare him,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Get up, wench,” cried one of the men. “Let
your mistress alone. See here, captain, she’s not
a bad-looking jade. I’ll help myself to her, by your
leave, and ship her to my wife.”</p>

<p>Lutie leaped to her feet and rushed toward the
in-coming figures of Jubal and his guard. Jubal,
with dogged expression, came slinking in behind
the soldier. “Found him easy enough,” said the
latter. “Here, get out of the way, girl.” He
gave Lutie a kick.</p>

<p>“Save me! Save me, Jubal!” Lutie wailed.
“Dey gwine sen’ me off, an’ I nuvver come back
no mo’. Oh, save me, Jubal!”</p>

<p>“Shut up,” cried the captain. “Here, boy,
didn’t you tell us there was a deserter around
here somewhere?”</p>

<p>“Ya-as suh, I—I—done said so,” Jubal stammered.</p>

<p>“Well, where is he? This lady protests that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>he is not here.”</p>

<p>Jubal rolled his eyes upon his mistress, and
then, with chattering teeth, said, “He were here,
suh.”</p>

<p>“Jubal,” said Lettice, solemnly, “do you mean
your Marster Tom?”</p>

<p>Jubal looked from one side to the other. “I
didn’ know hit were Mars Torm, in de fus’ place,
Miss Letty, an’ when I fins dat out, I skeered to
say nobody heah. Beside dat, Mars Torm gimme
a whuppin’ oncet.”</p>

<p>“And you deserved it,” cried his mistress.
“You ham-strung his colt because the creature
kicked you when you were stealing a ride on him,
and you deserved worse than a whipping. You
always were a bad fellow, Jubal. I wonder that
father did not sell you long ago. I would to
Heaven he had!”</p>

<p>“Then your man spoke the truth. There was
a deserter here,” said the captain, turning to Lettice.</p>

<p>“There was, if so you choose to consider him,
but he is gone. He left us this morning, and
when you arrived he was far on his way.”</p>

<p>“Why did you not say so at once?”</p>

<p>“That he might be farther on his way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>“Ah-h!” The man smiled. “Well, miss, we’ll
search the place, anyhow. There may be other
things to learn, and we’ll take your maid as a
punishment to you for defying his Majesty’s servants.
We will leave your loyal man to your
tender mercies.”</p>

<p>Lettice laid her hand on Lutie’s shoulder. “I’d
rather you’d leave the maid, sir. It seems to me
the man is more devoted to your cause than
mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jubal, save me, save me!” Lutie wailed.</p>

<p>“Stop that noise,” said the captain, sternly.
“Here, boy, I want you. We’ll have a lark, my
men. The man shall fight for the maid. If he
puts up a good fight, we will let her go, and if he
doesn’t, we will take her. Give him a sword,
Clarke. We’ll have fair play.” But as soon as
Jubal saw the sword and felt himself freed from
the grasp of his captor’s hand on his shoulder,
with one wild yell, he rushed out pell-mell, head
over heels, every soldier after him.</p>

<p>“Now’s your chance,” cried Lettice, to the terrified
Lutie. “Run, Lutie, run to the attic. I’ll
hide you.” And in the same place that had offered
shelter to her brother a few days before, she
hid the girl, and then she ran lightly downstairs.
She reached her room before the soldiers returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
and was busied with her packing when they again
appeared, laughing and shouting.</p>

<p>“The fellow had nimble heels,” said the captain.
“He got away, and I venture to say he’ll
not stop this side of Baltimore, unless Clarke
catches him, for he is still in pursuit. I’ve told
him he can have him if he catches him, and
Steele, here, will take the maid. Where is she?”</p>

<p>“That you will have to find out for yourselves,”
returned Lettice, dauntlessly.</p>

<p>“Aha, you refuse to tell? What shall we do
about it, Steele? Shall we capture the mistress
instead? We might take her a short trip to Kent
Island for her health, eh, Steele?”</p>

<p>“Divil a bit, will ye,” cried a voice at the door.
“Ye murtherin’ spalpeens, ye’ll take Miss Lettice,
will ye? Ye’ll take this!” Then crying,
“Come on, bhys!” Pat Flynn, laying about him
with cudgel and sword, so lustily began his defence
of the girl, that in a moment one man was
disabled and the others had fled, pursued by Pat
with his wild Irish yell and his shouts of: “Come
on, bhys, we’ll not lave the villyuns a whole hair
to split. Come on, the whole pack of ye!” Lettice,
seeing that the “bhys” existed wholly in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>Pat’s imagination, speeded his rescue by whistling
up the dogs and setting them on the fleeing men
who, with dogs worrying them, an Irishman’s shillalah
setting their heads buzzing, at last got off
the place, vowing vengeance.</p>

<p>“We’ve no time to lose,” said Pat. “They’ll
like be on us again as soon as they can get rayinfoorcemints.
We’ll have to get out purty quick,
Miss Letty. Where is Miss Betty?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. How did you happen to
come just in the nick of time? I didn’t know
you were well enough to show such strength.”</p>

<p>“’Tis all the doin’s of the old naygur woman,
sure, Miss Letty. She’s that grand a nurse I
never saw. I’d have been away from here this
good bit, but she advises me to lay low, sayin’
there’s trouble brewin’, an’ I might be needed.
’Twas she, the cute old owl of a crittur, that give
me the hint to slip in on ye aisy loike this mornin’,
‘fur,’ says she, ‘there do be some o’ thim divils o’
ridcoats goin’ in the direction of the great house,
Misther Pat,’ says she, an’ I picks up the shillalee
I’ve been havin’ by me this week back, an’ off
I goes. The swoord, ’twas me luck to find outside
the dhoor. Ye’d betther not be wastin’
toime, Miss Letty, dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>“But that wounded man in my room?”</p>

<p>“Lave him there. He’ll git no betther place this
long while, I’m thinkin’. I’ll be afther gittin’ the
horses and carriage ready as quick as I can, Miss
Letty, an’ do you an’ Miss Betty thry yer purtiest to
git off.”</p>

<p>“Betty! Sister Betty!” Lettice’s call rang through
the silent house. “Oh, where are you?” She ran
up and down stairs, and at last from the drawing-room
came a smothered answer, “Here.”</p>

<p>“Come out from your hiding-place. Wherever
you are, come quick.” And from behind the pile of
green boughs placed in the fireplace to screen it, a
grimy, sooty Betty appeared, with her baby in her
arms. The little fellow had kept a noble silence,
although but half understanding that there was a
cause for fear. Every servant on the place had made
for the woods when the word had gone forth that
the redcoats were chasing Jubal. Even the house
servants had not been able to resist joining in the
general stampede, and Lutie, up in the little closet,
alone remained.</p>

<p>“Hurry out and get into the carriage,” cried
Lettice. “It is around by the side of the house.
Pat Flynn is there. Hurry, hurry, Betty; don’t stop
to wash your face. I am coming in one minute.”</p>

<p>Betty caught up a bag of the articles she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
already packed, and Lettice called from the window
to Pat to please try to get her trunk on behind.
Then she skurried about, picking up this thing and
that, and thrusting it into a pillow case which, when full,
she pitched out of the window. This done, with fleet
steps she ran up to the attic. “Out with you, quick,
Lutie!” she cried. “Come as quick as you can, or
you will get left behind.” And Lutie, after scrambling
out on the roof and down the chimney on the
other side, reached her mistress, who stood waiting for
her. “You will be safe, Lutie, if you hurry!” she
told her. “Come on. Don’t stop to get anything.”
She grasped the girl’s arm and fairly dragged her
down the steep stairs. Yet, pressed for time though
she was, she could not forbear stopping at the door
of her room to look in at the man who lay on the
floor. He was the same who had claimed Lutie. A
sudden thought of Jamie froze all compassion from
Lettice’s breast.</p>

<p>“Sir, we leave you to the tender mercies of your
own friends,” she said. “You see I mean to keep
my maid. You cannot send her to your wife.”
Then she turned with a gentle smile to Lutie.
“Come,” she said, “we will go, but I think we may
never see the old house again, and I do not think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>you will ever see Jubal again, Lutie.”</p>

<p>The maid caught her mistress’s hand in both of
hers and laid her smooth brown cheek upon it.
“Yuh loves me better’n Jubal does, Miss Letty. He
lef’ me. He wa’n’t willin’ ter fight fo’ me. Yuh
didn’t run an’ leave me, Miss Letty. De Lord bless
yuh, my Miss Letty. I don’ spec I uvver see dat
fool Jubal agin, an’ I don’ keer. I belongs ter yuh,
an’ I is say my pra’rs ter God A’mighty fo’ dat till
I dies.”</p>

<p>“We take our leave of you, monsieur,” said
Lettice with a sweeping courtesy, as she turned to
leave the doorway. The man shook a feeble fist at
her as she disappeared.</p>

<p>“To leave my room so occupied is dreadful,” said
Lettice; “yet better that than to be dragged from
it myself. Good-by old home,” she cried, waving
her hand. “We may never see you again.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say so,” Betty entreated. “I want to
think I am coming back soon.” But she, too, gazed
out as long as she could, and until the trees hid the
last bit of the white house.</p>

<p>True enough, it was a last look, for an hour
later a band of angry men appeared, who, after having
rescued their fallen comrade, plundered the house
and set fire to it, and by night only a mass of smouldering
ruins remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>The carriage was driven along at a lively pace, Pat
proving himself as good a driver as a fighter. He
had fully recovered from his wounds and was eager
to get back to Baltimore, to see service, and to find
Mr. Joe. Young Tom Hopkins had started for the
North to join his father. “To show him that I mean
to do something to wipe out my past record,” he
said.</p>

<p>Pat would not give any credence to the belief that
Joe was lost. “He’s gone off to some av thim furrin
countries, an’ is lookin’ out fur prizes. He’s not lost
at all, to my thinkin’,” he said. This Lettice wrote
to Patsey, who was much comforted thereby.</p>

<p>Patsey, too, had retreated from her home to a safe
distance, and was with friends in Washington. She
had begged Lettice to go with her, but Lettice had
refused, saying that she would be better content
in a quiet place, where the merry ways of her little
nephew would bring her more solace than could anything
else. She devoted much time to the little
fellow, who grew more and more winsome every day,
and was so adored by Betty’s parents that he was in
danger of being spoiled.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the year Lettice passed in
a quiet village in the county of Kent. Betty, glad
enough to be with her own family, soon regained her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
spirits; and Lettice herself, deeply as she grieved
over the loss of her brother, was not uncomforted by
the return of her eldest brother, and by the assurance
of being in as safe a place as was afforded. Tom, be
it said, had thrown himself heart and soul into the
war. He had too many scores to settle, not to deal
such blows as opportunity allowed him. For a
month or so life was very peaceful for Lettice, and
then came a new trouble: Lutie disappeared.
Whether she had stolen off of her own accord, or
whether she had been captured, could not be discovered.
Lettice firmly believed the latter to be the
truth, and mourned her little maid with real sorrow.</p>

</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>A Time of Rest.</i></p>


<p>The winter passed without special incident to
Lettice and the household where she was
sheltered, but the spring brought a renewal of depredations
along the shores of the Chesapeake, and
again Cockburn and his men were dreaded and
feared. It was one day in the summer of this year
of 1814, that Betty and Lettice, sitting out on the
porch, discussed soberly their year’s experience.</p>

<p>“Rouse yourself, Letty dear,” said Betty. “Do
not look so sad. I wish we had not started this
topic. I know what memories it has stirred, but
you are too young to let your thoughts dwell on
grief continually. Here, take the boy; he has been
fretting to go to you ever since we came out here.
I shall be jealous of his love for you after a while.”</p>

<p>Lettice held out her hands for the pretty child
who, clutching his mother’s finger, took a step forward,
tottered, and then threw himself with a gleeful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>laugh into Lettice’s arms. “Pretty boy, he will
soon toddle about everywhere,” said Lettice, hugging
him up close to her. “I am so glad you are
not old enough to be a soldier, baby; and I hope
there will be no more wars in your lifetime.” She
sighed, and laid her cheek against the child’s sunny
hair.</p>

<p>“There, Lettice, don’t be so doleful. Let me
see, what can we talk about that will be more
cheerful? Did you not have a letter from Rhoda
yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did. She is at home in Boston, and
writes that the blockade is exciting them up there;
that the cry against the administration is louder than
ever, and that they are in a state of fear and dread,
continually.”</p>

<p>“And what of Mr. Clinton? That is a subject
which I think might interest you.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t mention him,” replied Lettice, shortly.</p>

<p>“Does he know that you have learned of his
innocence in the matter of the papers?” Betty
asked, after a short silence.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wrote to him as soon as I knew. I
thought I could not do less. It was right, wasn’t
it, Sister Betty?”</p>

<p>“It certainly was. Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“He never has answered my letter.”</p>

<p>“Then he is certainly very rude, and entirely
unworthy of my little sister’s regard.”</p>

<p>“But think what a dreadful charge it was; no
wonder he cannot forgive me.”</p>

<p>“He should have written, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“But if he had nothing but resentment to express,
it was better that he should not, I think. At all
events, I have said I am sorry, and I can do no more.
I acknowledged that I had formed hasty conclusions,
and was as humble as I could be.”</p>

<p>“Which was an acknowledgment against your
will, I know. He should have appreciated the fact
that it went against the grain for Lettice Hopkins
to eat humble pie for the sake of any man. You
liked him a little, Lettice?”</p>

<p>“I liked him very much at one time, but I never
liked him well enough to give up all for him. I
should always have disagreed with his opinions.
We quarrelled often, and after all this, it would be
impossible for us to forget what had come between
us. Besides, after the sorrows I have had, I never,
never could care for any one who sided with those
who were the cause of them.”</p>

<p>“And Rhoda, what does she say? Rhoda was
very fond of our dear Jamie, I well know.”</p>

<p>Lettice did not reply for a moment. She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
rocking her little nephew, whose eyelids were beginning
to droop over his bright eyes. “He is almost
asleep,” Lettice remarked. “I cannot tell about
Rhoda,” she went on to say. “She is a very dutiful
daughter, and although I think she will never
forget Jamie, she is young, and some day she may
marry, as it would please her father to have her.
Ah me, Sister Betty, trouble makes one feel very old.
I was such a careless thing a couple of years ago;
but when I think of my two brothers and my father
all in peril, of my home destroyed and my friends
scattered, is it a wonder that I am sad?”</p>

<p>“No wonder at all, dear child, but I predict
happy days for you yet. I see a gallant young
officer, splendid in his uniform, riding toward my
lady sister, and she all smiles and blushes.” Betty
leaned over, tipped back Lettice’s head, and looked
down with laughing eyes at her. “I see the smiles
and the blushes,” she said, kissing her forehead;
then, lifting her head, she gave a start and looked
intently toward the gate. “Oh, Letty,” she cried,
“I see the officer in the flesh! Look yonder, coming
up the lane.”</p>

<p>Lettice lifted her eyes; then dropped them and
continued to rock the sleeping baby until a voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>said, “Ah, Miss Lettice, I hoped to find you here.
What a sweet, peaceful picture is this to a man who
has seen only the deck of a frigate for the last six
months. May I sit here?” He took the chair
Betty had just vacated and leaned forward to put a
gentle finger on the baby’s soft hair. “How he has
grown,” he remarked. “I am tremendously glad to
see you, Miss Lettice.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad to see you, Mr. Baldwin.”</p>

<p>“You look pale, and scarce as sunny and blithe
as I remember. But I recall that you have passed
through deep waters since I saw you.”</p>

<p>The tears gathered in Lettice’s eyes, and one fell
on the golden head pillowed on her arm.</p>

<p>The young man viewed her sympathetically. “I
wish I could have spared you such a grief,” he said
gently. “Believe me, I feel it deeply. We were
companions in great peril, Miss Lettice, and I cannot
feel that we are the strangers our short acquaintance
would seem to suggest. Will you not tell me
all that has befallen you since we met? I have
heard only fragmentary reports.”</p>

<p>“I must take baby in, and then I will tell you,”
she responded.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp46" id="i_248" style="max-width: 58.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_248.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">“<i>How he has grown!</i>”</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Let me take him,” cried the young man, eagerly.
And as gently as possible he lifted the sleeping boy
in his arms, touching his lips softly to the fine, pink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
little cheek, and the act won Lettice’s favor more
than a deed of valor could have done. Over her
sad little face broke a smile, and she looked up with
such a glance that the young man hummed softly
to himself, “‘From the glance of her eye shun
danger and fly.’ Where shall I take him, Miss
Lettice?”</p>

<p>“In here on this couch, and then come speak
to Mr. and Mrs. Weeks. We all want to hear the
war news. Mr. Weeks, you know, lost an arm in
the Revolution, and frets that he cannot go fight
the British now. He is always very eager for
news.”</p>

<p>“Then I will satisfy his eagerness as well as
I can.”</p>

<p>They found Betty’s father in the spacious sitting-room.
He was a fine-looking old gentleman, gray-haired
and erect. Near him sat Mrs. Weeks; she
was much younger than her husband, being his
second wife and the mother of Betty, whose half-brothers
and sisters were all married and living in
homes of their own. Betty stood behind her father’s
chair. She was arranging his cue, for he still clung
to the fashions of half a century before, and to either
Betty or Lettice fell the daily duty of tying the cue
he wore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Baldwin has just come from the city,”
Lettice announced.</p>

<p>“And brings news, no doubt. Welcome, Mr.
Baldwin.” The old man sprang to his feet, and with
his left hand gripped the strong right one of the
young officer. “Well, sir, we’re sitting here pining
for news. What is the latest?”</p>

<p>“The best is, that Jackson has ended the war with
the Creeks.”</p>

<p>“Good! Jackson’s a great man; would there
were more like him in this fight against England!
What next?”</p>

<p>“We’ve had some reverses in Canada, sir, but—”</p>

<p>“But we don’t give up, eh? No, sir, we do not.
We may see the country running red with blood, but
we’ll hold on, at least we Southerners will; we’ve
inherited enough of the bulldog from England to do
that. I suppose Massachusetts is still fussing and
fuming and threatening to secede.”</p>

<p>“I regret to say it is so, and I regret it the more
that I am from Boston, myself. I think, sir, that it
would be a wise thing if you would all get nearer the
city, for I hear that an order has been issued by the
British commander, Cockburn, to lay waste all districts
along the coast, and to spare only the lives of
the unarmed inhabitants; this, I believe, in revenge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
for a small raid made by a party of Americans who
crossed Lake Erie and destroyed some buildings at
Long Point.”</p>

<p>“Humph! what of the outrages committed along
our coast?”</p>

<p>“We don’t forget them, sir. We will also retaliate
when we get a chance.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, sir, I wish I had my good right arm, I’d
join you. As it is, they’ll not find this inhabitant
unarmed, despite his empty sleeve.” He laughed at
his joke, and clenched his fist with a frown a moment
after.</p>

<p>“Now, father,” Mrs. Weeks protested, “you
wouldn’t offer fight. You’ve given enough for your
country. No one could expect more.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t what is expected; it is what I want to
do. I suppose the old graybeards up your way, Mr.
Baldwin, would call me a terribly hot-headed fellow.”</p>

<p>“A certain number might, but we young men
honor you, Mr. Weeks. I pray you, don’t censure all
New England for the attitude of a few. To be sure
they are leading men, and the Peace party is strong
up there, but we furnish some good fighters when all
is told.”</p>

<p>“I believe that. I hear Providence has voted
money for fortifications in Rhode Island, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
the shipmasters in Portland have formed themselves
into a company of sea-fencibles, and that even your
own state has caught the fever and is preparing for
defence.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am glad to say she is touched at last, even
though the Federalists still urge their militia to stay
at home.”</p>

<p>“What a contrast to Kentucky and her gallant
governor, leading his men to the front.”</p>

<p>“There, father, there,” came Mrs. Weeks’s soft
voice. “You always get excited over that. Mr.
Baldwin is a Boston man, remember.”</p>

<p>“But not a Federalist,” replied the young man,
smiling. “You surely will consider this question of
getting farther away from the coast, Mrs. Weeks. It
is really not safe for you here.”</p>

<p>“We can ill leave our place just now,” said the
intrepid Mr. Weeks. “I am determined to stand by
my home till the last. Yet, in the main, I agree
with you. Betty and her mother would better take
Lettice and the boy and go up to the city.”</p>

<p>“Not I,” Mrs. Weeks objected decidedly. “If
you stay, so do I; but I insist that Betty and Lettice
shall leave. It is what your husband would wish,
Betty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“If you could make it convenient to leave to-morrow,
I would be happy to be your escort,” Mr.
Baldwin told them. Yet it was only after much
protesting on Betty’s part that the safety of her
precious baby became, at last, the inducement which
decided her to go up to Baltimore under Mr. Baldwin’s
care. Mrs. Tom Hopkins was there, ready to
open her house to them, and glad enough to have
her loneliness invaded by the cheery presence of
a baby.</p>

<p>To Lettice, however, the house was too full of
memories for her to feel other than depressed within
its walls, and Patsey’s eager letters, urging her to
come to her in Washington at last had weight even
with Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>“The child looks pale and peaked,” she said.
“She needs young company to cheer her up.”</p>

<p>“So she does,” Betty agreed. “She has been all
these months with staid married people, like myself
and my parents, and she needs girls of her own age.”
Betty spoke sedately, as one whose youth had
long past, but Aunt Martha quite approved. She
objected to an approach to frivolity in married
women. “Patsey still keeps up hope,” Betty went
on. “I suppose you have had no word of Joe, Aunt
Martha?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“No, but I’ve had good news from my husband.
At last we have something besides reverses on the
Canada frontier.”</p>

<p>“And such glorious victories at sea! It makes
one very proud of our little navy that has been so
snubbed and scorned.”</p>

<p>“Proud indeed! We have some good patriots.
I am lost in admiration over those Kentuckians.
What an example their governor has set to the
people of the country! There is a patriot for you.”</p>

<p>“And here’s another,” laughed Betty, patting
Aunt Martha’s hand. “You aren’t much of a Federalist,
Aunt Martha.”</p>

<p>“I am not, I confess. I am disgusted with all
these squabbles about the administration, when the
foe is at our very doors. Suppose we are taxed,
we should have no money for the war, else; and
to pretend it is unjust and as bad as the taxation
of the colonies by England before the Revolution
is ridiculous. Next there will be civil war, if this is
not stopped. Massachusetts may go out of the
Union if she chooses, but I’ll not go with her,
dearly as I love my own state. And I venture to
say that is the opinion of the greater part of her
people. It is only the politicians who make all
this ferment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>“Good!” cried Lettice. “Aunt Martha, I love
you for that. I wish Rhoda and her father could
hear you. I suppose Mr. Kendall still adheres to
his opinions.”</p>

<p>“My brother? Yes, he is blind to everything
but his resentment toward the administration, I
am sorry to say.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Martha certainly does improve with age,”
said Betty to Lettice, as she was helping the latter
to pack her trunk. “She speaks as tenderly of
Cousin Joe as if he were her own son, and she is
perfectly devoted to the baby. Poor Cousin Joe!
I wonder where he is?”</p>

<p>“Patsey declares he is in some prison, and I
don’t doubt but that she is right,” said Lettice,
lifting the cover of her bandbox to see if her best
hat were safely inside.</p>

<p>“I hope, then, he is not in that dreadful Dartmoor
Prison,” said Betty. “I declare, Lettice, I
forgot to ask Aunt Martha about Mr. Clinton. I
wonder where he is?”</p>

<p>Lettice gave her head a little toss. “It needn’t
concern us where he is.”</p>

<p>“You’re well off with the old love, aren’t you,
dear?” Betty said. “And as for the new, I’ll
warrant the way to Washington will not seem
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>very long with him as escort. Yet, I don’t see,
with all the fine fellows here in Baltimore, why
you couldn’t have chosen one nearer home. You
are bound to be a Yankee, at all hazards, it
seems.”</p>

<p>Lettice laughed. “I haven’t chosen any one,
Sister Betty, and it is all very silly to take it for
granted. Why, honey, I may have a dozen fancies
yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. You and Ellicott Baldwin
are cut out for each other, I must say, though I
oughtn’t to, you little monkey, for I don’t want
you to leave your own state, and go live up there.
However will you manage to subsist on baked beans,
I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Goosey! Am I such a poor stick that I can’t
cook what I like? And, besides, I could take one
of our own servants with me,—Speery, for instance,—and
teach her.”</p>

<p>Betty, who was sitting on the floor, hugged her
knees and rocked back and forth in glee. “So
it’s all settled, is it? How many times have you
seen him, Lettice?”</p>

<p>Lettice blushed furiously. “Nothing is settled
with anybody anywhere, silly girl. I only meant
that if I ever did have to live in New England,
that my home training would prevent me from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
starving, if I should chance not to like Yankee
dishes. That is all.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is all, Miss Innocence. Let me
see; when I was your age, I had been engaged to
William a year, and had all my wedding clothes
ready. I shall expect an announcement when you
get back from Washington.”</p>

<p>“It looks like you do want to be rid of me, after
all. Do you suppose I want to marry a man who
would be at sea half his time, and who would leave
me to mourn at home while he was off, nobody
knows where? No; give me one of our own domestic
swains, I say.”</p>

<p>“It’s all very well to talk,” Betty returned, “but
you’ll be a Yankee yet.” At which Lettice made
a face at her, and, having finished her packing,
declared that she was tired to death, and that she
did miss Lutie more than ever.</p>

<p>“Lutie loved to pack. She would rather have the
chance to handle my gowns than to eat, and that’s
saying a good deal. Poor Lutie!” Lettice sighed.</p>

<p>The next morning she started for Washington,
and it was a coincidence that one of the passengers
going by the same coach was none other than
Lettice’s former travelling companion, Mr. Francis
Key, who at once recognized Miss Hopkins, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
who had the discretion not to obtrude himself too
frequently upon her attention, since it was evident
to his perceptions that the young naval officer who
devoted himself to the girl was quite able to entertain
her. And though the way was long, the end
of the journey did not seem greatly to be desired
by either of the two.</p>

<p>“Dear, oh me, Lettice, but I certainly am glad
you have come,” Patsey said, as the two girls, with
their arms around each other, and chattering as
fast as their tongues could run, made haste to get
to the refuge of Patsey’s room, after Lettice was
landed on the doorstep of Mrs. Gittings’s house in
Washington. “That is a fine new spark you had
dancing attendance on you,” Patsey went on, when
the two had seated themselves comfortably by a
window overlooking the Potomac.</p>

<p>“Is he not a good-looking fellow?” Lettice returned.
“He is from Boston, yet he is as stanch
a fighter and as eager for the war as any Marylander
or Kentuckian.”</p>

<p>“And you like him very much?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I hope not too much, for he joins his
ship to-morrow, and I would not have my heart
rent asunder should he never return.” Then, seeing
the effect of her words, she threw her arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
around Patsey. “Ah, Patsey dear, I should not
have said that. I should have remembered. But
no news is good news, they say; so do not let us
look for the ill news that flies quickly.”</p>

<p>The house where they were was on Capitol Hill,
which neighborhood then represented about all there
was of Washington. “I am glad you came to-day,”
Patsey told her friend, “for this afternoon there is
to be a fringe party at the Ingles.”</p>

<p>“A fringe party?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you know it is quite the fashion to meet
around at each other’s houses and make fringe for
the soldier’s epaulets. The government is too
poor to buy it, and we can’t have our boys go
without.” Patsey sighed, and Lettice knew of
whom she was thinking.</p>

<p>“You’ll be my cousin yet, Patsey,” she said,
and Patsey gave her a grateful smile; but despite
their girlish enthusiasm over Lettice’s arrival, each
noted that the other looked sadder and was
quieter than when they last met.</p>

<p>“War is a dreadful thing,” said Patsey, shaking
her head. “I never knew how dreadful till I
came here to Washington and heard the talk that
our brave men have been beaten and made prisoners,
up there on the frontier, or have been massacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
by Indians. I wish there were no war. I am
patriotic, I hope, but I think the New Englanders
are half right when they say, ‘Anything but war.’”</p>

<p>“Even disgrace?”</p>

<p>“Even disgrace; for we have had that, in spite
of all our fighting.”</p>

<p>“But we have had some rousing victories at
sea; quite enough to encourage us to keep up a
good heart. No, Patsey, with all I have lost, I
still believe it was right for us to fight.”</p>

<p>“You have more spirit than I, for I would
grovel on my knees, give up everything, be a
British subject, or anything else, if it would but
give me back my Joe safe and sound. You don’t
know what it is to feel so, do you, Lettice dear?
Your heart is not so deeply touched.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe it is,” she replied slowly.</p>

<p>“Yet, I venture to say it beats quicker when a
certain person is near,” returned Patsey, patting
her hand. “Come now, my sister will wonder if
we are going to stay here all night without a
word to her.”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, as Patsey said; war, war, politics,
politics, were all that Washington people talked
about. The news from Europe was scarcely less
eagerly looked for than home news, and when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
became apparent that Napoleon’s power was overthrown,
and that England was free to send her
transports laden with troops to attempt the subjugation
of the United States, the seriousness of the
danger threatening their native land aroused men,
north, south, east, and west.</p>

<p>“Every seaboard city is in peril,” the people
said one to another, and one August morning into
Washington galloped an express messenger with
the news that a large fleet of British men-of-war had
been seen in the Potomac. It was evident that,
despite the obstinate refusal of the Secretary of
War to admit the possibility of an attack upon
the nation’s capital, precisely that was the object.
The militia began trooping into town. Few had
uniforms; they were without bayonets, and were
so poorly equipped that it seemed a farce for them
to attempt to withstand a foe which had just triumphed
so signally against Napoleon at Waterloo.</p>

<p>There was much talk, much advice, and great
excitement. No one seemed to know what was to
be done, or whose orders were to be obeyed, and
in consequence of this state of affairs, at first
appearance of the British the raw militia, without
hesitancy, ran for dear life.</p>

<p class="ph3"><i>A Day of Disaster.</i></p>


<p>“How hot it is; how hot it is!” said Lettice,
on that memorable morning of August 24,
1814. “How uncomfortable one can be in this
world! Here we sit nearly dead with the heat,
and full of anxiety for our friends. They are fighting,
Patsey, fighting. My fathers! when it is so
near home one only then can realize the terror of
it. Our poor fellows in this choking, blinding dust,
and with the sun pouring down on them, must be
in a pitiful state. And how will it end?” She
wrung her hands, and began to walk restlessly up
and down the floor.</p>

<p>Patsey in a big chair, fanning herself languidly,
said, “Letty dear, you’ll not be any cooler for stirring
about. Do try and sit still.”</p>

<p>“I can’t. Indeed, I cannot. Hark! Here comes
some one.”</p>

<p>The door was suddenly opened, and before them
stood a man, his features so obscured by the dust,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
mud, and blood which plastered him from head to
foot, that he could not be recognized at first glance
in the semi-darkness of the room. He looked at
them wildly and burst into a hysterical laugh.
“We ran,” he said, “all of us. We ran pell-mell,
head over heels, every mother’s son of us.” There
was the sound of a choking sob, and he drew his
dusty sleeve across his eyes and sank into a chair,
breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Lettice ran to him. “William, Brother William,”
she cried, “it is you! Are you hurt?” She
peered anxiously down into his face.</p>

<p>“Hurt? No; didn’t I tell you I ran? How
could I be hurt?” He fairly snapped out the
words, and she looked at him bewildered.</p>

<p>“You poor boy,” she said gently, after a pause.
“What a sight you are. You must be worn out.
Come, get freshened up a little and tell us all
about it.” She urged him into the next room, and
they waited his return in silence. Once Patsey
said, “Do you suppose he is crazed, Lettice?”</p>

<p>She gave a short sob. “I don’t know. It is
not unlikely, after this day’s heat and fatigue. He
never spoke so to me in all his life. Oh, Patsey,
did you see the blood?” Both shuddered, and
again silence fell till William appeared, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
somewhat more like himself. He stood gazing
fixedly at the wall and, without their questioning,
began in a hard voice:—</p>

<p>“We were marched and marched from pillar
to post for no purpose but to be kept marching
it seemed. It was at Bladensburg that the British
were. We scarcely believed they were anywhere,
but suddenly, when we were exhausted
with the heat and the dust and the fatigue of
marching, we went out to meet the enemy. Nobody
seemed to know anything. All was confusion
and want of discipline. We began well
enough, but somebody cried, ‘Run,’ and there was
a sudden panic. We did rally from that and
stayed our troops, but it was no use; some fool
cried out that we were beaten. We were not!
We were not! By Heaven, it is too much! We
were holding our own well, but the idiots who
started the stampede kept up the cry, and, like
a flock of sheep, one followed another till the flight
was complete. Barney’s marines fought well, I’ll
say that for them. I tried to get to them, for I
had a dim sort of idea that I could do my part,
and at least save my honor by fighting with the
sailors, but I was swept along with the rest, and
by and by became possessed only with the notion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
of getting on as fast as I could. It seemed to
be the universal intention.” He laughed again
mirthlessly. “We were raw, undisciplined troops,
to be sure, and our enemy had fought under Wellington
against Napoleon, but we could have beaten
them, I am sure of it. Why didn’t we? Why
didn’t we?” He clenched his hands and strode
up and down the room.</p>

<p>Lettice watched him wistfully, not knowing what
to say to this discouraging tale. “Barney’s marines
at least did good service,” at last she said dolefully
to Patsey in an undertone, “and I am sure my
brother would have stood his ground if he could,
even if the others did run away.”</p>

<p>William smiled grimly, and appeared to come to
his senses. “I am not here to excuse myself,” he
said, “but to get you girls out of the city as quickly
as possible. The enemy are coming.”</p>

<p>“Truly? Here?” they cried, each grasping an
arm, and looking at him in alarm.</p>

<p>“Truly indeed.” He shook his head with rage,
and bit his lip fiercely. “War on paper, in truth.
A pothering, chattering set of civilians, without an
idea of how war should be carried on, have allowed
the enemy to rout us, to beat us, to enter our capital.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>But there, girls, I’ll not stop to vent my anger now.
You must hurry over to Georgetown as quickly as
you can. We’ll not be the first. Listen!” He
threw open a shutter, and the girls looked forth,
to see a terrified crowd of people flocking from every
direction. Wagons loaded with household goods
were rumbling past the house, all moving in the
direction of Georgetown.</p>

<p>Patsey fled from the room. Below stairs already
could be heard a commotion of the removing of
heavy furniture, of opening and shutting of doors, of
hurried footsteps.</p>

<p>“Get your things together, Lettice,” said her
brother. “I will go below and see if I can help Mrs.
Gittings to get away. Where is Steve Gittings?”</p>

<p>“He is with the militia,” Lettice told him.</p>

<p>“You mean <i>was</i>,” returned her brother, his grim
humor not deserting him. “Probably he cannot run
as fast as I, or he would be here by this.”</p>

<p>Lettice for answer took his hand and laid her
cheek against it. “You are so tired,” she said.
“Come, rest awhile. It must have been terrible,
marching in this dust and heat.”</p>

<p>“It was, but—if there had been any one to tell us
what to do or where to go, stiff, choking, miserable
as we were, we could have maintained our places; but
it was simply a rabble, with nothing but confused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
orders and no real head. What could we do?” He
suddenly broke down and, to Lettice’s distress,
sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>She slipped from the room, and although Patsey
and her sister were hurrying to get their most valuable
possessions together, she managed to get a glass
of raspberry shrub and a bit of bread to take to her
brother, for hunger was added to his other discomforts.
She found that he had regained his self-control
and was busying himself in helping the family to
depart.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gittings, for the sake of her children, consented
to flee. “But if Steve comes, how will he
know where we are?” she complained.</p>

<p>“He will know you are safe, and I am going to
stay and see the end of this; as soon as I get you
safely over the bridge, I mean to come back here,”
William told her.</p>

<p>Lettice gave a half-suppressed, “Oh!”</p>

<p>He looked at her and smiled. “I can take care of
myself. I proved that this morning, and perhaps I
can do some good in some direction. God bless you,
little sister.” He kissed her and lifted her upon a
pile of bedding in the wagon. Mrs. Gittings, with
the children crying with fright, and Patsey, scarcely
less agitated, were already established in the wagon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
which at once set out to join the procession. There
was no room for another in the already full wagon,
and although William insisted in following on foot
to see them safely out of town, they persuaded him
to remain where he was, telling him that he was too
worn out to do more, and that if he should drop by
the way, he would but add to their distresses.</p>

<p>The hot sun beat down mercilessly; the air was
filled with stifling dust as the long line of wagons
and foot passengers, with not a few on horseback,
moved toward the bridge spanning the shores from
Georgetown to Virginia. The President and Mrs.
Madison had gone over, the latter waiting till the
last moment to oversee the removal of a valuable
portrait of General Washington from the White
House. Many officials also could be seen in the
midst of the frightened crowd that poured over the
bridge.</p>

<p>Lettice, with clasped hands and quivering lips,
gazed at the white walls of the Capitol looming up
dimly through the veil of dust. Running away!
Every one was running away it seemed. Her mind
took fantastic ideas; they were a troop of ants
swarming from an ant-hill; they were the animals
trooping into the ark; they were anything but the
citizens of an American city fleeing from a ruthless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
foe. The blinding, choking dust enveloped her. It
was the pillar of cloud which led the Children of
Israel. Yes, there were the multitudes crossing the
Red Sea, with Pharaoh and his host behind them,
and yonder red flare on the shore was the pillar of
fire. These fancies possessed her as the wagon rumbled
on, and finally reached Georgetown, where it
halted. “And over there is the Promised Land,”
she said aloud.</p>

<p>Patsey turned and looked at her. “Are you daft,
too, Lettice?” she said.</p>

<p>“Yuh ladies bleedged ter git out,” said their sable
driver; “dat hin’ wheel give a mighty ornery creak
de las’ time we strike a rut, an’ I is bleedged ter
tinker her up a little befo’ we goes on.” And out
they all clambered, while Simon went off to a neighboring
blacksmith shop for assistance.</p>

<p>Patsey, with the hot hand of one little child in
hers, stood among the company of refugees, while
Mrs. Gittings tried to soothe her fretful baby.
“If I only had a little milk to give him, I think he
would be quiet,” she said. “He is hungry, I
know, poor darling. It was useless to bring milk
with us; it would not have kept an hour in this
heat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll go and see if I can find any,” Patsey said.
But the little Dolly clung to her, crying, “I don’t
want my Patsey to leave me.”</p>

<p>Lettice spoke up. “I’ll go, Patsey. I see a
little place over yonder; maybe I can get some
milk there.” And without further words she
crossed the street to a shop on the other side.
But no milk was to be had, and she trudged farther
off. The sun beat down on her, and she
felt ready to sink from exhaustion, for she remembered
she had not eaten anything since morning,
and very little then. She looked for her purse,
but remembered that she had, in her excitement,
placed it in her trunk. She stood still in perplexity.
She could only beg some milk for a hungry
baby; she could not offer to pay for it unless
she went back to Patsey for the money. She was
about to re-cross the street, when a pair of horses
which had taken fright, came dashing along, and
she felt herself suddenly snatched back. Looking
up she saw Mr. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Miss Lettice,” he cried, “I did not dream it
was you. Another moment you would have been
under those horses’ feet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I was just going to cross, and
I got bewildered. I feel a little queer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“And no wonder, in this broiling sun. I venture
to say you have had nothing to eat for hours
and are tired as well.”</p>

<p>“That is about the truth. I was trying to get
a sup of milk for Mrs. Gittings’s baby. See, she
and her sister are over there, by that wagon at
which the man is working. We came near having
a breakdown and had to halt.”</p>

<p>“You were on your way to Virginia, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“That is good. I think perhaps I can help you.
See, there is Tomlinson’s hotel; do you remember
it?”</p>

<p>“Where the ball was held? Oh, yes.” She
looked up at him and smiled, and for the first
time noticed that his face did not wear its usual
sunburnt hue. “You have been ill!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He held up a bandaged arm. “Yes, I have been.
My hand and a bit of my forearm were shot away
about a month ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and were you very ill?”</p>

<p>“So, so. We will not talk of it now. Come, I
think we can get the desired milk in here. They
know me well, for I put up here when I am
in town.”</p>

<p>“And you have been here, how long?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“I arrived some days ago, but was scarcely in a
state to pay my respects. I am out for the first
time to-day.”</p>

<p>“It is not a very good day, either. I am so
very, very sorry to hear of your wound,” said
Lettice, looking her compassion.</p>

<p>They had reached the hotel by this time. Mr.
Baldwin pushed open the door and ushered her into
the hall. How well she remembered the place,
and that night of rejoicing over victory. Now
the triumphant British were entering the city,
and the little army of militia was scattered. She
remembered Mrs. Madison, as she stood there,
the centre of attraction. Now she, too, was a
refugee. She had time for no further reflections,
for Mr. Baldwin returned with a cup of milk
and a couple of slices of bread with some cold
meat.</p>

<p>“This is not very inviting,” he said, “but it was
all I could get, and it will stay you. Shall I carry
the milk over to your friends, and will you rest
here till they are ready to go on?”</p>

<p>“No, I will go too. How good of you to get
this,” she added gratefully.</p>

<p>They arrived before the little group waiting by
the wagon, to find that Simon persisted that he
could not carry the load, for the vehicle was weak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
anyhow, and might break down any minute, even
if partly unloaded. “It would be perfectly safe
for any one to stay here, don’t you think so?”
Lettice asked Mr. Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it would; at least for the present,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then I will be the one to stay. I can go to
some friend’s here, or I could even go back to the
house. I heard that ever so many families were
simply going to lock and bar themselves in, and
would not leave. Brother William will be there,
and he would look out for me. Please go on without
me, Patsey. I am sure the Ingles will take
me in. I heard little Mary say that they were not
going to leave.” And after much protesting
against all this, by Patsey and Mrs. Gittings, it
was decided that they would go on, and that
Lettice should seek such shelter as she could find.</p>

<p>“You are very brave,” Mr. Baldwin remarked,
as they stood watching the wagon slowly creaking
along over the bridge. “But I remember it is not
the first time I have seen evidences of your courage.
Now, we must find you quarters,” he
added.</p>

<p>“I should best like to return to Mrs. Gittings’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>house.”</p>

<p>“I think you are safer here.”</p>

<p>“And you? To be sure you have not your
uniform, but you will not expose yourself to danger,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Not unnecessarily. I am <i>hors de combat</i>, as
you see, though I still have a right arm I shall
put to such service as I can. We must decide
upon the safest spot for you, Miss Lettice. Where
shall it be?”</p>

<p>“I will return to Mrs. Gittings’s, if you will be
so good as to take me.”</p>

<p>“Please let me persuade you to remain here.”</p>

<p>“No, I feel worried about my brother. He was
well-nigh crazed by reason of his disappointment
and fatigue, and I may be needed. I am not
afraid; truly I am not. If he is not there, I can
take refuge with neighbors.”</p>

<p>“I am very loath to agree to such a decree.”</p>

<p>“But if I so greatly desire it.”</p>

<p>“Even then I cannot feel that it is a wise thing to
do.”</p>

<p>“But I assure you that others have remained who
have quite as much at stake. Mr. Henry Ingle’s
home is close by the Gittings’; take me there, and I
shall be quite safe.” And at last overruled by her
persuasions he consented, and, after much trouble, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
conveyance was found which returned them to the
city of Washington, into which the triumphant British
were already entering.</p>

<p>The silent house, bolted and closed, showed no
signs of life when Lettice and her companion
appeared before it. “Do you think your brother is
here?” Mr. Baldwin asked.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” was the reply. “If we could go
around by the back way, we might get in. The key
will be in its usual place. Mrs. Gittings was particular
that it should be, that her husband might be able
to find it, in case he should return.” They made their
way around to the rear of the house and discovered
the key to the side door, where it had been left under
an overturned flower-pot. They let themselves in
and crept upstairs in the semi-darkness, going from
room to room till they found in a heavy slumber, outstretched
upon one of the beds, Lettice’s brother
William.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow,” whispered the girl, “he is thoroughly
worn out.”</p>

<p>She leaned over him, and he stirred slightly; then,
conscious that some one was looking at him, he
opened his eyes and started up, crying, “Halt!
Who goes there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>“Only your sister, brother dear,” Lettice answered.</p>

<p>“Lettice,” he exclaimed. “What are you doing
here? What has happened? I thought you safely
over the river by this time.”</p>

<p>“The wagon broke down, and Simon declared it
would not carry so many, so I came back. Mr. Baldwin
brought me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Baldwin? Where did you encounter each
other?” He peered around and perceived the figure
standing in the doorway. “Come in, my dear
fellow,” he exclaimed. “I owe you a debt for bringing
this wayward little sister of mine safely here.
Aha! you are wounded? Were you with the
marines?”</p>

<p>“No, I was hurt in an engagement down the bay
some weeks ago and have been on the invalid list
ever since. We beat them that time,” he concluded
quietly.</p>

<p>“You are fortunate in having so honorable a result.
I wish I could say the same.”</p>

<p>“Brother William is fairly morbid on the subject
of to-day’s disaster,” said Lettice. “Let us not talk
of it.”</p>

<p>Her brother turned to her. “I have not heard
how you and Mr. Baldwin chanced to meet.”</p>

<p>“We encountered each other in Georgetown, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>Mr. Baldwin has been staying.”</p>

<p>“And where I tried to persuade Miss Lettice to
remain.”</p>

<p>“And where I wouldn’t,” she added. “I thought
if anything dreadful were to befall us, I would choose
to be with one of my own family, and I do believe
we are as safe here as anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we are,” returned her brother, thoughtfully.
“If persons keep within doors, I think nothing
will likely happen to them, unless the enemy set
fire to the city.”</p>

<p>“Oh, would they do that?”</p>

<p>“Have they not done so elsewhere? But never
mind, little sister, we’ll have to take the risks,
now we are here. You will not think of returning,
Mr. Baldwin, with the streets full of British
soldiers.”</p>

<p>“No, he must not,” Lettice said decidedly.</p>

<p>“I bow to your decision, which is more than
you did to mine,” he returned, smiling.</p>

<p>“Hark!” cried Lettice.</p>

<p>“They are here,” groaned her brother. For
now the tread of advancing feet, the exultant
shouts of a victorious army, were heard. Night
was approaching, close and warm after the hot,
debilitating day, when up the avenue came the
irregular lines of the British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>“It is fairly suffocating in here,” said Lettice;
“let us open the windows.” But the words were
hardly out of her mouth before a shot struck the
closed shutters, and the girl started back with an
exclamation of alarm.</p>

<p>“I think we shall have to stand the heat,”
remarked her brother, quietly. And indeed it
would have been a rash thing to open the shutters,
for every now and then, from the ranks of
the redcoats were sent stray bullets to fall harmlessly,
since no one dared to open a door or
window.</p>

<p>“If only they don’t fire the town,” said William,
as he walked the floor restlessly. Lettice, with a
strained look on her face, sat with clasped hands
in one of the farther corners of the room. At
last Mr. Baldwin, more venturesome than the
others, opened a shutter a little way and peeped
out.</p>

<p>“They seem flocking from every direction,” he
said, as he drew in his head. “The streets are
full of them, shouting, singing, firing on whomever
they chance to see.”</p>

<p>“What was that?” cried Lettice, springing to
her feet. For from the direction of the Capitol
came the sound of a rattle of musketry, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
closely by a second volley, both accompanied by
the crash of glass.</p>

<p>“Ah-h,” groaned William, “they have not the
manhood even to spare that;” for through the
clinks of the shutters could be seen the glare and
smoke of an ascending fire. The Capitol was in
flames.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>A Time of Dreadful Night.</i></p>


<p>The night grew darker and darker. Not one
of the three in the house thought of sleep,
for from time to time the crackle and blaze of
some new fire, the roar of the devouring element,
announced that one or another building had been
sacrificed to the revengeful lust of the enemy.
Up and down the streets swarmed the redcoated
soldiers, ransacking, shooting wildly, without reason
or conscience, at any who dared venture forth not
uniformed as were themselves.</p>

<p>With the advancing hours the gathering of a
storm became more and more apparent. Sharp
lightning vied with the rollicking flames. Deep
growls of thunder drowned the sound of carousals,
and the wind, rising to a fury, lashed and whipped
the trees, tore away roofs, and shrieked as if in
defiance. Soon down came the rain in torrents,
in floods, and the flames, so eagerly mounting
higher and higher, became less and less aggressive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
In the battle between the two elements fire was
vanquished. Save for the raging of the storm,
there was now little noise in the streets, and the
occupants of more than one closely shut house
ventured to open the windows to let in the cool
air which was sweeping away the intense heat of
the day.</p>

<p>“It is a merciful interposition of Providence,”
declared William Hopkins. “I think we can take
some rest and feel no alarm while the storm continues.
Go to bed, Lettice.” And Lettice, feeling
suddenly heavy-eyed and weary, now that the strain
was relieved, obeyed and soon sank into a deep
slumber.</p>

<p>She awoke early, for the sun was shining in
at the window which she had left open. She sat
up in bed, for a moment bewildered. “Patsey,”
she called; then suddenly she remembered, and
she sprang up, venturing to peep out into the
street. As she looked she saw an officer on a
white mare galloping up the avenue; a little colt
trotted behind; it seemed an incongruous sight in
that scene of desolation. The streets were full of
bits of paper, some charred and soaked with rain;
there were further evidences of the work of
plunder, of tempest, and of destruction, but Lettice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
did not dare to look long, for groups of soldiers
were becoming more and more numerous, and she
did not know what moment a chance shot might
come her way.</p>

<p>She closed the shutters softly, dressed herself,
and ran downstairs. “I must try to get up some
sort of breakfast,” she said to herself, as she rummaged
through closets and pantry. She was fortunate
in finding coffee, bacon, corn meal, and some
sour milk. With deft fingers she kindled a fire,
and then discovered that the water buckets were
all empty. “Water I must have,” she said, “and
I will have to go and fetch it from the pump. It
will be better for me to go than one of the men,
for I’m what Brother Tom calls a non-combatant.
Poor Tom, I wonder is he safe?”</p>

<p>She sighed, and picking up a bucket, sallied
forth into the street. More than one person had
ventured out. There were no soldiers near enough
to inspire fear, and she felt quite safe as she ran
along toward the old wooden pump which stood
before the house occupied by her friends, the Ingles.
A little girl was sitting on the doorstep. “It’s
plain to see you’re not afraid, Mary,” said Lettice,
as she vigorously worked the pump-handle up and
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>

<p>“No, I’m not,” returned Mary. “I came out
to see the soldiers.”</p>

<p>Lettice, having filled her bucket, lifted it and
set it on the sidewalk. At that moment a British
officer, attended by an orderly, came riding up the
street. He paused before the pump, and drawing
out a silver goblet, summoned his orderly. “Here,
bring me a drink of water in this goblet of old
Jimmy Madison’s,” he said.</p>

<p>Then up spoke Mary Ingle. “No, sir, that isn’t
President Madison’s goblet, because my father and
a whole lot of gentlemen have got all his silver
and papers and things and have gone—” From
the doorway some one reached forth a silencing
hand, which was placed over Mary’s mouth, and
the little maid was drawn within doors. Fortunately
the officer had been drinking freely and did not
notice the candid statement. He quaffed his draught
of water and rode off.</p>

<p>Lettice did not tarry either, but lifting her bucket,
which weighed down her slender arm, she made
ready to carry it home. She noticed that fires
were again starting up in every direction, and she
felt a quiver of fear for the safety of herself and
her friends. What if the whole city should be
swept by flames?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>

<p>Setting down her heavy bucket, she stopped a
moment for rest. From across the street stepped
a young officer, gay in his red uniform. “Let me
carry that for you, my pretty maid,” he said. “It’s
good water; I have tasted it, and I’ll carry your
bucket home for you for a kiss.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no.” Lettice shrank back.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I say.” He drew nearer, and, picking
up the bucket, held it, laughing. “No kiss, no
water.”</p>

<p>“Then no water.” And Lettice turned and fled,
leaving the soldier laughing at his own defeat.</p>

<p>The girl hurried on and entered the gate, which
she securely fastened, but behind which she stood
for a moment, peeping through the chinks, determining
that water she must have as soon as there
seemed a chance of getting it. But at that instant
she noticed that the sky had again begun to
darken, and almost before she could reach the
safety of the kitchen, a hurricane swept the city.
It suddenly became as dark as night; the wind,
which had been high enough the night before,
now arose to the violence of a cyclone. Roofs
were torn off, trees uprooted, and the air was
full of flying particles. Even things ordinarily
supposed to be secure were wrenched from their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
fastenings and went hurtling through the air as
if the law of gravitation had suddenly become
naught. The rattle of thunder, the sharp lightning,
the tremendous downpour of rain—all these
were terrifying, and Lettice dared not go on with
her preparations for a meal.</p>

<p>Before many minutes down came her brother
and Mr. Baldwin. “Up already?” they said.</p>

<p>“Already? Do you think it is still night? It
is long past breakfast-time, and I did hope to
have it ready for you, but I was so scared I could
not go on with it, and besides, I have no water.”
Then she related her encounter with the redcoat.</p>

<p>“You perverse child, will you never learn prudence?”
said her brother, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“I am afraid not,” returned she, so earnestly
that her brother smiled.</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” she said triumphantly, “I saw Admiral
Cockburn on his white mare, riding up the
avenue this morning. It was when I first got up,
and it was so funny to see the little colt trotting
on behind.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it was he?” her brother
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“Mary Ingle told me when I was talking to
her this morning. Dear me, I wish I had Lutie
here.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you haven’t,” returned her brother.
“Lutie is a perfect baby, and afraid of her own
shadow; she’d be worse than no one at all in all
this.”</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed Lettice, “what a report
that was! The lightning has struck somewhere
very near, but it shook the whole house.”</p>

<p>“That was no lightning stroke,” Mr. Baldwin
declared; “it was an explosion of some kind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope nothing has happened to our friends
at the Arsenal.”</p>

<p>“It seemed to come from that direction.”</p>

<p>There was no cessation of the terrible storm,
and Lettice finally declared that water they must
have. “If I only could have brought my bucket
safely home,” she said wistfully.</p>

<p>“There is water enough,” Mr. Baldwin said
quietly, “when it is coming down in sheets
like this. Just set something outside to catch
it. Here, I will do it.” And he picked up a
water bucket and placed it where it would soon
fill.</p>

<p>“What a goose I am!” said Lettice. “Why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>didn’t I think of that? Did you get very wet?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of. May I help you get
breakfast? What can I do?”</p>

<p>“You may set the table, if you will. Brother
William is bringing candles; I am glad of that,
for I could scarcely tell meal from sugar in this
light.”</p>

<p>The three busied themselves in preparing the
simple meal and ate it with a heartiness which
long fasting supplied. “There are more fires
lighted; I believe every building of any importance
has been set fire to,” said Lettice, dolefully.
“And to think of being in the midst of all this
dreadful time! I am so thankful for this rain;
maybe it will put out the fires. It does seem as
if a special providence had sent it. Isn’t it a
terrible storm! Why, I even saw feather beds go
flying through the air.”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldwin laughed. “Those feathers probably
flew higher than they ever did before,” he remarked.</p>

<p>They were feeling quite cheerful since their
meal and were now sitting at one of the back
windows watching the steadily descending rain.
William had left the room, saying he meant to go
in to see the Ingles and hear if they had any
news to give. “We have shared more than one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>danger,” said Lettice, after a while. “I feel now
as if when this war comes to an end, there must
be a few of my friends who will be linked to me
by stronger bonds than those of an ordinary
friendship.”</p>

<p>“I am glad then that I have been of the privileged
few, though I would rather have spared you
these sad experiences. I wish I could have borne
them for you,” her companion said.</p>

<p>“Have you not borne enough?” Lettice gave a
glance at the bandaged arm.</p>

<p>“A trifle, compared to that which some suffered,
yet sufficient to dash some bright hopes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” Lettice looked down.</p>

<p>“A man who has nothing but his chosen profession,
and who has lost his chances of promotion
in that, must stand aside and let others win what
neither fortune nor honor will permit him to ask
for,” he replied steadily.</p>

<p>“But everything is not to be won by fortune
and honors.”</p>

<p>“Would a man be justified in seeking the love
of a woman to whom he can offer nothing but a
very uncertain future?”</p>

<p>“If a woman loves a man, does she care to give
any one else the right to win her?”</p>

<p>Just then, with a shriek and a wail, a gust of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
wind arose, and hurled against the window a
branch wrenched from a tree. It came with such
terrifying force as to shiver the glass, and almost
simultaneously came a vivid flash of lightning and
a terrific crash of thunder. Lettice, stunned and
frightened, staggered against the wall and slid
helplessly to the floor, affected by the lightning
which had struck a tree near by. In an instant
Mr. Baldwin was by her side. He lifted her
head to his shoulder, murmuring, “My love, my
darling, are you hurt?”</p>

<p>She raised her head, half dazed, and looked at
him without speaking; then her head dropped
heavily on his shoulder again, and he held her
thus, till in a few moments this sudden dash of the
storm had abated. Then both rose to their feet.</p>

<p>“I wonder where William is?” Lettice said
faintly, and suddenly feeling shy. “He—” She
did not finish her sentence, for her brother entered
the room.</p>

<p>“I’ve been out,” he said, shaking the drops
from his hat. “I went first to the Ingles and
heard some news there, and then I thought I
would look around a little for myself.”</p>

<p>“In all this fearful gale?” Lettice said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I knew there would be little danger from
the redcoats while this storm lasted. Fires are
smoldering in every direction. That explosion we
heard was caused by the throwing of a lighted
torch into an old well where part of our powder
was secreted. Twenty-five Britishers were hurled
into eternity by the explosion, and many were
badly wounded. I think this experience, on the
whole, has been too much for Cockburn, for I was
told that he is getting ready to leave.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad!” said Lettice. “Did none of
those flying boards hit you?”</p>

<p>“No, I managed to dodge them, and I didn’t go
very far. I see you have had an accident here.
We must stop up that window; the rain is pouring
in.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Lettice looked down, and the color
which had left her cheeks came slowly back
again.</p>

<p>“Miss Lettice narrowly escaped being struck by
lightning,” Mr. Baldwin said unsteadily. “She
was sitting near the window when that tree there
was struck, and she was stunned. A heavy branch
torn from the tree did the damage to the window.”</p>

<p>“And you were not hurt, Lettice? You are
sure?” Her brother looked alarmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>“No, I think not. I felt dazed, and my head
still feels queer, but I was only a little stunned,
I think. I am beginning to feel all right again.”</p>

<p>“The wind is dying down, though it is still
raining hard. I think the worst of the storm is
over.”</p>

<p>The rain continued for the rest of the day, but
evening brought the tramp, tramp, of retreating
feet. Orders had been given that no inhabitants
should appear in the streets after eight o’clock;
this that the enemy might escape unnoticed. The
city, devastated as it was, received final destructive
touches from the outgoing enemy, who set
fire to every important building still unharmed,
as the retreat was being made. The departure of
the foe seemed also to be the signal for the cessation
of the tempest, for the setting sun shone
forth, and the mutterings of thunder died away
with the echoing tread of marching feet.</p>

<p>“Free, at last!” cried Lettice, when it became
known that the redcoats had really gone.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not safe. We’re not out of the
woods yet,” her brother told her. “Every man
of us must fight those fires, or the little that’s left
will go. Run in and stay with the Ingles, Lettice.
Mr. Baldwin and I must go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, but—but he is not well enough.”</p>

<p>“I can carry a bucket of water,” said the young
man, smiling down at her.</p>

<p>“And ask no reward?” she said in a whisper.</p>

<p>He turned around and looked at her searchingly,
so that a soft pink overspread her face. “Would
you give it?” he whispered back. Then he bit
his lip and turned away before she could answer,
leaving her half abashed at her own words, and
half sorry that she had let him go.</p>

<p>She ran out of the gate to her good neighbors
and found them rejoicing at the departure of the
enemy, but still in alarm lest the surrounding fires
should break forth and destroy the dwellings still
standing. However, many willing hands were
ready to stifle the rising flames, and forlorn, miserable,
wretched-looking as the poor little city
appeared, its season of trial was over.</p>

<p>The despoiled capital was a poor abiding-place, but
as soon as Patsey and her sister returned, they urged
Lettice to stay, rather than to go back to Baltimore,
whither her brother was bent on hurrying; for it was
said that General Ross had his eyes turned upon that
place. “And they will not come here again, for they
have taken all there was to take. Bad as it is, there
is one consolation—if there is one place above another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>that is absolutely safe, it is Washington,” said
Patsey. “You would better stay with us, Lettice; I
should think you had seen about enough of this war.”</p>

<p>But Lettice shook her head. “It is dreadful to
think of anything happening to Betty and the baby,
and my brother will be there. I must stick by my
family through thick and thin.” And she set forth,
to arrive in Baltimore, there to find every one apprehensive
of an attack from the British.</p>

<p>Betty hugged and kissed her, and declared it was
dreadful to think of the scenes she had witnessed;
and then she ran to her husband and cuddled in his
arms, putting her hand over his lips when he attempted
to tell her of the defeat. “I won’t hear it,”
she cried. “I don’t care if they all did run. I’d a
thousand times rather that, than to have you brought
home to me dead or wounded. I am tremendously
thankful you didn’t give them a chance to shoot you.
I am so thankful that I cannot consider anything
else.”</p>

<p>“I believe I agree with you,” Lettice joined in.
“What do you think of it, Aunt Martha?”</p>

<p>“I think he could do no less, under the circumstances.
It was not his fault that there was a retreat,
and he would have been foolish to stand up alone
and defy the entire British army.” At which they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>all laughed and settled down composedly to hear Lettice’s
story. Danny curled himself up in one corner,
all alert for thrilling adventures, and Mrs. Flynn
stood in the doorway, one hand on her hip and the
other thoughtfully manipulating her chin as she listened.</p>

<p>“An’ now tell ’em your bit o’ news, ma’am,” she
said, turning to Mrs. Tom Hopkins, when Lettice
had finished her tale.</p>

<p>“We’ve heard from Joe,” Aunt Martha told them.</p>

<p>“Oh!” Lettice sprang to her feet. “Where is
he?”</p>

<p>“In Dartmoor Prison, poor fellow; and that is
almost worse than to hear of his death, for it is
doubtful if he will ever get out alive.”</p>

<p>“How did you hear?”</p>

<p>“Through a fellow-prisoner, who made his escape,
and who promised, should he succeed in getting
away, that he would get word to us of Tom’s whereabouts.
We are all working, and my brother is using
his influence to get an exchange.”</p>

<p>“Would you tell Patsey?”</p>

<p>“I think I would not, just yet—not till we are a
little surer that our plans can be carried out.”</p>

<p>“Have you anything to tell me?” asked Betty,
as she came into Lettice’s room that night at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>bedtime. “William has told me that you saw
much of Mr. Baldwin, and that you left him but
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“So we did—but, oh, Betty, he cannot go back
into the service, because he has lost his left hand
with a part of his arm, and he has no money; and,
besides, he wouldn’t ask me if he had, for he doesn’t
think a man maimed and without a profession of some
kind would have a right to do it.”</p>

<p>“Neither would he. But never mind, my love, I
wouldn’t make myself unhappy over it; love finds
a way. And would you take your Yankee lad single-handed?”</p>

<p>“Now, Betty, you will joke. Yes,”—she hid her
face on Betty’s shoulder,—“I would, I really would.”</p>

<p>“I said you would be a New Englander yet. I
shall have to hand you over to Aunt Martha to-morrow
and let her teach you how to bake beans.”</p>

<p>“But there’s no need. You see, he’ll not ask for
me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; wait till the war is over. What about
Robert Clinton, Lettice?”</p>

<p>“What about him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; you don’t care one wee little bit for him?”</p>

<p>“No, no, no!”</p>

<p>“Does your—what is his name?—Ellicott know
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I wouldn’t be likely to take him
by the lapel of his coat and say, ‘Mr. Baldwin, I
want you should know I don’t care for Robert Clinton.’”
Lettice imitated Rhoda’s tones so exactly that
Betty laughed.</p>

<p>“No, you couldn’t do that,” she agreed. “Now
I have something to tell you. He, like an honorable
gentleman, has told William that in a moment of
excitement, when he thought you were in danger, he
declared his love for you, and—”</p>

<p>“And—oh, Betty, what? He has never referred
to it since; and tell me, what did William say?”</p>

<p>“He requested him not to see you or communicate
with you till your father’s permission could be
obtained.”</p>

<p>Lettice heaved a deep sigh. “And what did he
say?”</p>

<p>“He promised, but asked that you might know;
so, as William had no liking to tell you himself, he
asked me to do it. So there—my disagreeable task
is over. Do you forgive me for my part in it?”</p>

<p>“I thank you for your gentle way of telling me,
and I would rather have heard it from you than from
William.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, dear. Now, never mind, my honey,
just bide your time. For myself, I like Mr. Ellicott<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
Baldwin mightily. Don’t you miss poor Lutie, when
it comes to a matter of toilet?” she asked, to change
the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, poor Lutie, I do miss her. Ah, Betty dear,
you are truly like my own sister. You understand
so well, and I like better to be with you than any
one. Alas, where will be our home?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t bother over that. Let the future take
care of itself. ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof,’ you know. You have seen evil enough,
poor Letty. Good night and sweet dreams;” and
she left Lettice to think over all this new situation.</p>

<p>Volunteers were tramping into the city; preparations
were going forward for a brave defence, and
when Lettice laid her head upon her pillow, it was
to dream of future alarms and start up more than
once with a little cry. Once Betty heard her and
came in to bend gently over her. “She is only
dreaming, poor little soul,” she murmured. “What
a peck of trouble she has had, to be sure.”</p>

<p>The morning seemed to realize Lettice’s dreams,
for Danny came in, his eyes rolling around in excitement.
“M-m-miss Letty, dey done comed, dey done
comed!” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Who?” cried Lettice, looking up from the
flowers she was arranging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“De redcoats. Dey ships in de ribber; dey is,
fo’ sho’. I ain’ tellin’ no sto’y, Miss Letty.”</p>

<p>Lettice knew danger was near, for her brother,
who had gone out the night before, had not returned,
and she saw that vigorous measures were being
adopted for the defence of the city. She thought of
Washington and sighed.</p>

<p>“Is yuh skeered, Miss Letty?” asked Danny, who
was watching to get his cue from her.</p>

<p>“Not scared, but very anxious. Where is Miss
Betty?”</p>

<p>“She puttin’ de baby ter sleep. Miss Marthy, she
fussin’ roun’ lak a ole hen.”</p>

<p>“Sh! You mustn’t talk that way,” Lettice chided,
in a severe tone. “Aunt Martha,” she said, stepping
to the window which looked out upon the porch where
she was, “do you suppose it is really true that the
British are here?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, child. I am distracted. Ought
we to stay or go? I do want to do my duty.”</p>

<p>Lettice smiled. “I don’t see that anything will
be gained by going; at least, not yet. I think we are
about as safe here as anywhere. Oh, Aunt Martha,”
she clasped her hands closely, “we’ll conquer or
we’ll die. I am sure this time we must drive them
back. We have good defences; Mr. Key told me so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
last night, and he said, ‘We are in earnest this time;
they’ll not find it so easy to get into Baltimore as
into Washington.’”</p>

<p>Aunt Martha stood considering the situation.</p>

<p>“Where would you go, if you did leave?” Lettice
asked.</p>

<p>“Somewhere out of town; but as you say, no doubt
we are as safe here as anywhere we might hit upon.
It doesn’t seem a very fitting time to be arranging
flowers, Lettice. You’d better be scraping lint;
there probably will be need of it.”</p>

<p>“But the flowers don’t stop blooming, battles or
no battles,” Lettice returned. Yet she bore her
bowl of China asters indoors, and, taking a roll of
linen from her aunt’s hand, she sat down to scrape
lint.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>The Star-Spangled Banner.</i></p>


<p>From time to time during the day came news
of a possible engagement. Frigates, bomb-ketches,
and small vessels were reported to be ranging
themselves in position to cannonade the fort and
the town. Off North Point lay the ships of the line.
In the night began the debarkation of the British, and
by noon the next day a battle was imminent. It was
an anxious time for those within the town, whose
brothers, husbands, sons, or lovers had gone out to
meet the enemy. Aunt Martha religiously refrained
from idleness, and vigorously scraped her lint when
she was doing nothing else. Lettice and Betty
helped her by fits and starts. “But I cannot keep
my mind on anything,” said Lettice. “I am so
nervous, so anxious.”</p>

<p>“You’d much better be occupied,” returned her
aunt, patting a soft pile of her linen scrapings. But
Lettice did not respond; she went to the window
and looked out. Few persons were to be seen on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
the street. It was raining, and she wondered how
those on their camp ground were faring.</p>

<p>All day Sunday there came reports of the further
movements of the British, who had by this time
landed their troops at North Point; and what might
be next expected no one knew, though all feared ill
news. “I shall not stay at home from church,”
Aunt Martha declared, “for if ever there was a time
when one should attend to her religious duties, it is
to-day. You will come with me, Lettice?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I might as well, for I shall be just as
miserable if I stay at home, and I shall at least have
the satisfaction of knowing I am doing the right
thing by going.”</p>

<p>“That is not the right spirit,” Aunt Martha
objected. “It should be a privilege, and I think
you should feel it so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will try to; but I know I cannot keep my
mind on the sermon for one instant. I shall be
thinking of what is going on outside the city.” Yet
she accompanied her aunt without further words, and
announced at the dinner-table that she believed it
had done her good to go.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon of the following day came flying
reports that a battle was in progress. Next came
the news that the British general, Ross, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
killed. After this were various reports, and, throughout
the night, stragglers brought in accounts of the
day’s action. The next morning early came a sudden,
ominous sound. Lettice jumped from her bed. It
was six o’clock. She ran to her sister Betty’s room.
The baby, terrified by the sudden noise, was crying
with fright. “Isn’t it a hideous sound!” said
Lettice, placing herself at the foot of the bed.
“Hark! it gets worse and worse; it fairly shakes
the house to its foundations. Oh, Betty, do you
suppose they will get near enough to bombard the
city?”</p>

<p>“If they can get past the forts. Pray Heaven they
do not!”</p>

<p>All day the sombre sound of the cannonading continued.
At three in the afternoon it grew fiercer,
and those who waited in terror, now feared that their
beloved town would share the fate of Washington.
From the windows Lettice and Betty watched the
ascending rockets, and as night came on and the fearful
booming continued, becoming louder and fiercer,
it seemed as if every brick in the house must fall
about their ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly the noise increased in volume. It
sounded nearer. What did it mean? Betty and
Lettice, with one accord, rushed out into the street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
Throngs of anxious people, with pale faces and
terror-stricken eyes, were gathered there. “What
does it mean?” they whispered one to another.</p>

<p>All at once, as suddenly, a stillness fell. It was
an awe-inspiring silence. Betty clung to Lettice,
crying, “Oh, Letty, we are lost!” But the bombs
and rockets again began to illumine the sky, though
now at a greater distance, and when the morning
broke upon those who had sleeplessly kept their
vigil in the streets of the threatened city, the
danger was over. Baltimore was saved.</p>

<p>That night the British sailed away, and then those
who, so short a time before, had appeared a sadly
anxious company, driven by fear from their homes,
now gayly paraded the streets, cheering and shouting
as the triumphant troops marched by.</p>

<p>“I am glad we stayed. I am truly glad, for all
that it was so terrible. I am glad to get rid of
my recollections of Washington,” Lettice exclaimed.
“They have gone, Aunt Martha! They have
gone, Betty! Do you realize that it was a
victory?” And, seizing the baby, she danced
him up and down till he screamed with mirth
and excitement.</p>

<p>They had hardly recovered from their joy at the
victory, and the delight in welcoming home the ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
who had done so much toward winning it, when
other glad tidings came to them. Weak, miserable,
fever-wasted though he was, it was a day of rejoicing
for them all that brought Joe home again. Big
Pat Flynn and William lifted the wasted figure from
the carriage to the house, and Lettice, who was on
the lookout for him, ran to the door. She burst
into tears as she saw the mournful, hollow eyes,
and Aunt Martha, close upon her heels, chid her
with:—</p>

<p>“That is a pretty way to welcome the boy! Why,
Joe—” And then she, too, lost control of herself,
and, leaning on Lettice’s shoulder, began to weep.</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty way to welcome the boy!”
laughed William. “Here, Betty, can’t you do better
than that?” And Betty, whose chin was quivering,
gulped down a rising sob and smiled, saying:
“You dear Joe, how glad I am to see you! Welcome
home, Joe! Welcome home!”</p>

<p>“Heigho, Mars Joe!” came a small pert voice.
“Fo’ de Lawd, but yuh look lak a ole rooster what
los’ he tail fedders.”</p>

<p>“Halloo, Danny! Where did you pop from? If
I look like a scarecrow now, how do you think I
looked when I started for home, before I had a
good lot of fresh air and something to eat? Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
I’m a good-looking fellow to what I was,” said Joe,
laughing weakly.</p>

<p>Danny snickered, and Aunt Martha turned, saying
severely: “Danny, leave the room, and don’t
let me hear another word from you. Bring Joe
into the sitting room, boys, and we’ll make the
dear child comfortable;” which, indeed, they did,
so that within twenty-four hours he was looking
better.</p>

<p>Lettice’s first thought was of Patsey, and she
despatched a letter to her as quickly as possible,
and there were at least two perfectly happy persons
under that roof when Patsey responded in
person.</p>

<p>But on top of this came a sad letter from Lettice’s
father. “Our dear Tom, my brave first-born,
has gone from me,” he wrote. “He died to save
my life, for in a hand-to-hand fight, he threw
himself between me and my enemy, shouting, ‘I’ll
save you, father,’ and he received the blow that
would have finished me. I trust that I yet have
one son left, and though I would not have him
serve his country less well than those that have
been taken, I pray he may be spared to us, and
I beseech him not to expose himself to unnecessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>perils.”</p>

<p>“Dear old Tom,” Lettice murmured, with softly
falling tears, “it seems as if he returned simply
to retrieve himself and to leave behind a loving
memory of him. We can be proud of him, now.
But oh, Jamie has gone, and Tom has gone, and
all I have left is Brother William. Even Lutie is
taken from me.”</p>

<p>But a few days after this came a surprise for
Lettice. Danny, with dancing eyes, and ducking
his head as he gave frequent smothered
bursts of laughter, appeared at the sitting room
door where Lettice sat with her Cousin Joe and
Patsey.</p>

<p>“Somebody out hyar ter see yuh, Miss Letty,”
Danny announced, and then he ran.</p>

<p>“Come back here, you rascal,” called Joe.
“Haven’t you any better manners? Tell Miss
Letty who it is.”</p>

<p>Danny rolled his eyes toward the door. “She
say I isn’t to tell, suh.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind, I’ll go,” Lettice said.
She opened the door and stepped out upon the
porch. In one corner stood a figure in blue sunbonnet
and checked gingham frock; it looked
strangely familiar. With the sound of the closing
of the door the figure started forward, and a soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
voice said: “Praise de Lawd, dat mah Miss Letty.
I is got back.”</p>

<p>“Lutie!” cried Lettice, running toward the girl
and throwing her arms around her. “Where have
you been all this time?”</p>

<p>“’Deed, miss, I doesn’t know. Dem Britishers
done tek me off an’ ca’y me somewhars, I dunno
whar nor wha’fo’, an’ when de man what say he
own me gits killed in dat battle yuh-alls has, I
gits a chanst to run away, an’ I tu’ns mah face
todes Baltimo’, an’ I keeps a-inchin’ along, a-inchin’
along twel I gits hyar, an’ hyar I is. Law, Miss
Letty, yuh nuvver thought I done run away
mahse’f? No, ma’am, I ain’ no such notion. I
yo’ own gal, an’ I don’ nuvver want no other
mistis.” Lettice, in sheer delight, gazed at her as
if she could not believe her eyes. “I skeered yuh
git ma’ied, Miss Letty,” Lutie went on, “an’ go off
yonder wid dat Mars Clinton.”</p>

<p>“You need never be afraid of that,” said Lettice,
decidedly.</p>

<p>Lutie twisted her bonnet strings around her
finger. “Miss Letty, is yuh know what become
of Jubal?” she asked miserably.</p>

<p>Lettice shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<p>“I knows,” said Lutie, solemnly; “de po’ mizzible
sinnah is gone to glory, an’ I see him go.
Yass, ma’am; dey blow him into kingdom come,
’cause he such a sneakin’ varmint, an’ he try
to do dem redcoats lak he done yuh-alls, an’
dey don’ stan’ no such wucks, no ma’am, an’
dey ups an’ shoots him. Miss Letty, Danny say
young Mars Torm done gone to glory, too. Is
dat so?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Lettice, “he died bravely, Lutie;
poor dear Tom. Come in, now, and pay your respects
to Miss Betty and the rest. Aunt Martha
will have to let me keep you this time, for I don’t
intend to have you out of my sight till we are
rid of the British for good and all.”</p>

<p>Lutie willingly sought Miss Betty, and Lettice
reëntered the room she had just left. She saw
her Cousin Joe quietly sleeping, one cheek resting
on Patsey’s hand, which she would not withdraw
from its position. Although the lines of suffering
were still apparent upon Joe’s face, a happy smile
played around his mouth, and Patsey’s eyes wore
a look of supreme content.</p>

<p>That evening, when Lettice’s brother William
came in, he drew from his pocket a small printed
paper in handbill form. “Here, Lettice,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>said, “your friend, Mr. Francis Key, has distinguished
himself. It seems he was on board
one of the British ships the night of the bombardment—”</p>

<p>“A prisoner?” Lettice interrupted.</p>

<p>“Yes; he went to try to gain the release of
Dr. Beanes, of Upper Marlborough, and was detained
during the engagement. You can imagine
his feelings; uncertain as to the result of the
battle, and anxiously waiting through the long
night for some sign to relieve his doubts and
fears. The occasion, however, has given us a
beautiful ode. Mr. Key, after being kept some
time on board a British vessel, the <i>Surprise</i>, was at
last returned to his own cartel ship, the <i>Minden</i>,
and there, on the back of a letter, he wrote the
song I have just handed to you.”</p>

<p>“What is it called?” Betty asked.</p>

<p>“The Bombardment of Fort McHenry,” Lettice
read from her paper.</p>

<p>“Read it out, Lettice,” said her Cousin Joe, and
she began:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘Oh say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What so proudly we hailed by the twilight’s last gleaming?’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She read it through to the end to a group of
attentive listeners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>“Fine! Beautiful! A noble production!” came
the comments.</p>

<p>“It is not generally known that Mr. Key wrote
it,” William went on to say, “but his uncle, Judge
Nicholson, told me that it was a fact, and that
Frank had showed it to him, and that he, being
vastly pleased with it, took it to the office of the
<i>Baltimore American</i> and had a number of copies
printed, one of which he gave to me. Every one
is singing it, and it promises to become very popular.
The tune is that of ‘Anacreon in Heaven.’
You know it, Joe; come, join in. Come, Betty,
come, Lettice, let us try it;” and the Star-Spangled
Banner was given with spirit and fervor.
Several passers-by, catching the tune, started up
the air and went singing on their way, so that
after the song indoors was ended, from the distance
could be heard, lustily shouted:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘’Tis the Star-Spangled Banner! Oh, long may it wave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was toward Christmas that Lettice, coming
into her aunt’s room one day, found the good
lady pondering over two letters which she had
been reading. “Your father and your uncle are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>on their way home,” she announced abruptly.</p>

<p>“Oh, how very glad I am!” cried the girl.
“There are some good things left for us, after all,
Aunt Martha; though sometimes, when I think of
this war and all it has cost me, I feel as if it had
stripped me of everything.”</p>

<p>“This war, indeed; yes, I don’t half blame my
brother for calling it an unrighteous proceeding.”
She tapped the letter she had just been reading;
then she burst out again: “But we would have
been cowards not to have fought for our rights.
New Englander as I am, I must confess that the
Federalists are going too far. What does this
convention at Hartford mean but an attempt to
dissever the Union? For all that Edward excuses
it on the ground of an effort to thwart an incompetent
government, it means nothing more nor
less than an ugly word—secession.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Martha, really?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it looks like. However, let us
hope it will not come about. Here, you may read
the letter; there is one enclosed from Rhoda
which will give you her news, such as it is.”</p>

<p>Lettice read the two letters and returned them
without a word; then she went to the window
and looked out. “I am very fond of Rhoda,” she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>remarked after a little while. “Her letter did
not show that she was in very good spirits, Aunt
Martha.”</p>

<p>“Rhoda is not one to show great enthusiasm,”
Aunt Martha replied.</p>

<p>“No, I know that; but she does sometimes
write more cheerfully. I wonder will she ever
marry.”</p>

<p>Her aunt made no answer, but instead, arose
and observed, “I must get the house well in order
for Thomas’s home-coming.”</p>

<p>“Will they be here in time for the wedding?”</p>

<p>“They will make the effort.”</p>

<p>“I believe Patsey would be perfectly willing to
wait for the sake of having Uncle Tom here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in putting off weddings,” said
Betty, coming in. “It has already been put off
once. You must have a new gown for the occasion,
Lettice. I have been telling you that for
weeks; it isn’t like you to be so indifferent to
such things.”</p>

<p>“There is time enough before New Year’s Eve.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but time flies. Come, go down with me
and select it. There will be nothing so good
for you as a shopping expedition. I must stop
in Lovely Lane to attend to a matter, and then
we will give ourselves up to choosing your bridesmaid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
gown. Lutie can look after the boy, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and will be glad to do it. I must look
out for a gay calico for Lutie’s Christmas.”</p>

<p>“You spoil her,” remarked Aunt Martha.</p>

<p>“Maybe; but I am so glad to have her with me
again.”</p>

<p>She came down a little later, cloaked and tippeted,
her curls peeping from under her beaver
hat. Betty looked at her mischievously. “You
are decked out fairly well, Letty. I’ll warrant more
than one head will be turned over a shoulder to
look after you this morning.”</p>

<p>“I care not whether any turn,” sighed Lettice.</p>

<p>“Ah-h, that accounts for your pensiveness; your
poor little heart has slipped its leash, and you are
pining for—Did I hear Aunt Martha say she
had a letter from Rhoda? Lettice, you are not
mourning for Robert Clinton?”</p>

<p>“How many times must I tell you, no, no, no!”
replied Lettice, pettishly. “I don’t care a whit
for him, as you know well; yet, all this morning’s
news has brought back the past very vividly, and
makes me remember that my home is gone; and
my two brothers—one lies on the shores of the
great lakes, and one in our own forsaken graveyard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
To think that, after all, poor Tom should
be denied a resting-place beside his own kith and
kin.”</p>

<p>“What matters that to him? He has won himself
a lasting name for courage and faithfulness,
and that is a comfort. Now do put by these sad
thoughts and let us talk of the wedding. Oh, by
the way, I heard a piece of news; William says
Becky Lowe is to marry Stephen Dean. He has
won his lady-love after all these years of devotion.
There is nothing like perseverance, you see. Poor
Birket!”</p>

<p>“Why, poor Birket?”</p>

<p>“Because he didn’t persevere; he was too easily
set back.”</p>

<p>“Now, Betty, I never had a single thought of
Birket. He is a nice lad, but too young for my
liking.”</p>

<p>“I know that, my dear grandmother, and I
do not forget that your true love is a sailor
lad.”</p>

<p>“You mean he was. My dear love will never
again be a sailor.”</p>

<p>“There are other things he can be. He has
been true to his word, has he, Lettice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” she returned proudly. “If he
made a promise to William, he will keep it to the
bitter end.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is a great thing to be able to have
faith in one’s true love. Here we are. Now let
us see what we can find to make my little sister
outshine the bride.” And they were soon absorbed
in turning over mulls and muslins, till they settled
upon what suited them. Then came a visit to the
mantua-maker, and the two returned home in fine
spirits.</p>

<p>The days sped by, till the last day of the year
brought Patsey’s wedding-day. Sylvia’s Ramble
was opened to receive all the Hopkins tribe, and
Aunt Martha, more excited than Lettice had ever
seen her, went around with a duster from room to
room.</p>

<p>“Do sit down, Aunt Martha,” her niece begged.
“You will be tired out before night, and these
rooms are already as clean as hands can make
them.”</p>

<p>“My child, I can’t sit down. Why, Lettice, I
am to see my husband to-day, after all these years.”
She faltered, and mechanically moved her duster
back and forth upon the already polished table, on
which, all at once, a tear dropped. “There, I am
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>getting in my dotage,” said Aunt Martha, turning
away, ashamed of this evidence of emotion.
“Hark! Lettice, do I hear wheels?”</p>

<p>Lettice ran to the door. “Only Mose from the
store, Aunt Martha,” she reported. “The boat is
not in yet.”</p>

<p>But it was not long before there was a shout and a
hurrah, a clatter of hoofs and a rumble of wheels,
the shrill laughter of little children, as the pickaninnies
scampered to open the gates; and in they
swept, the long-absent soldiers in the carriage, Joe
and William on horseback, Patrick behind them all
on a lively mule; then in another moment the master
of Sylvia’s Ramble was at home again, while Lettice,
laughing and crying, was clasping her father’s neck
and gazing with loving eyes at his tanned, weather-beaten
face. “Father, my dear, dear daddy, you are
here safe and sound!”</p>

<p>“Here, you people,” cried Joe, “I want you to
know this is my wedding-day, and I expect all the
fuss to be made over me.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” cried Lettice, gayly. “People can get
married any day, but it isn’t every day that one has
a chance of welcoming back war-stained veterans.”</p>

<p>“Can get married any day, eh? Well, I haven’t
found that I could, or I’d have been a Benedict something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>over a year.”</p>

<p>“This is better than Dartmoor Prison, isn’t it,
Joe?” said his uncle.</p>

<p>“Sh! Sh! Let us have no such reminiscences to-day,”
said Betty. And then they all went into the
house to discuss the dinner, over the preparation of
which Aunt Martha had spent much anxious thought.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><i>Her Valentine.</i></p>


<p>Lettice was not long in seeking a private talk
with her father, there was so much that each
wanted to say without the presence of listeners; and
when many of the sad things had been talked over,
and when the gladness of the present again enfolded
them, her father drew the girl close to him.</p>

<p>“And what is this I hear of an impecunious
young fellow who has dared to make love to my
daughter?” he said.</p>

<p>“He didn’t, father, he really didn’t; he couldn’t
help himself, for it was in a moment of great suspense.”
And she told him the circumstances.</p>

<p>“And you have not given him any reason to hope
he may win you?”</p>

<p>“No-o. I don’t know. I like him, you know.”
She twisted a button on her father’s coat round and
round.</p>

<p>“Ah-h!” he shook his head. “That will not do,
my baby. You are too young to judge of what is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
best for you. Give him no more thought. I cannot
have my little girl throw herself away upon a poverty-stricken
fellow with no means of livelihood and not
likely to have any. You are still too young to have
this weigh long upon you, my love. Be guided by
your daddy, who thinks only of your happiness, and
give up this young man, if you love me.”</p>

<p>Lettice’s lip quivered, but she said bravely: “But
suppose I cannot help loving him, father. I would
not love you any the less; and it would only mean
that I would always be at home with you, if I were
faithful to him the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>“You have not seen him? He has kept his word
to William that he would not try to see you till my
return?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I know he is as true to me as I am
to him. If you say so, father, I will not see him
again, and I know he would not have me do anything
to make you unhappy, but—” She put her
head on her father’s shoulder to hide her wet
eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins looked troubled. “Well, my love,
well, just let me have time to look further into the
matter. I didn’t realize that you felt so about it.
Don’t let your old dad make you unhappy upon this
very first day of his home-coming. Cheer up now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
and let it rest as it is for the present. I promise you
to give the subject my best attention.”</p>

<p>Lettice put up her mouth for a kiss, feeling a little
more comforted. Surely her father loved her too
well to let her be miserable all the days of her life.
Perhaps, after years and years of waiting, when her
lad should have become a rich man through some
unexpected means, her father would consent; meantime
she would try to be happy, and she could at
least think of him, even if she didn’t see him.</p>

<p>If there was happiness and peace at Sylvia’s
Ramble, so there was a great joy in the home of the
fair bride. Such a glad ending to a sad year. Her
Joe’s wife! Faithful, loving Patsey had no other
thought; and when, as the day drew to a close, and the
guests from far and near came flocking in, each
whispered to the other, “Did you ever see such a
radiant face as the bride’s?”</p>

<p>“And when is your wedding to be, Lettice?”
asked Becky Lowe, important in her own prospective
marriage.</p>

<p>“Law, child, don’t ask me!” replied Lettice,
lightly. “But pray don’t insist that I shall be your
bridesmaid, Becky, if you would have me married,
for this is my second service in that capacity; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>first was at Brother William’s wedding, and you
know the old saying, ‘three times a bridesmaid,
never a bride.’”</p>

<p>“Who told you I was to be married?” simpered
Becky.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have to be told,” Lettice replied teasingly;
“it is a self-evident fact. Are we to have a
dance? So we are. With pleasure, Tyler.” And
leaving Becky, Lettice was led out upon the floor.
She longed, yet hesitated, to ask her partner when
he had heard from his cousin, and where was he?
But all of a sudden her heart stood still, for there in
close converse with her father stood her comrade in
many a perilous hour. He looked grave and was
talking earnestly. Lettice, so confused that she
forgot her steps, turned the wrong person, to the
amusement of her friends. “Who could ever suppose
that Lettice Hopkins would forget a dance?”
cried one. So she recovered herself and took better
heed to the figures of the Cauliflower, and at the end
of the dance was led back to her seat, her eager
little heart beating fast. Why did he not come and
speak to her? And O dear, why should her father
detain him? Did he mean that when he was separated
from her but by the distance of a few feet, he
was still to keep his promise to avoid her? Common
politeness would forbid that. Surely they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
talking longer than was necessary, and accounts of
battles and such things would keep till another time.
Yet, perhaps it was she of whom they were talking,
and the thought made her heart beat even faster.</p>

<p>Presently her father looked over to where she sat
and smiled at her; then he spoke a few words to his
companion and both came toward her.</p>

<p>“I have been thanking this young gentleman for
his several services done my daughter,” said Mr.
Hopkins. “I was fortunate in having the opportunity.”
Lettice looked up with a lovely smile and
murmured a few conventional words of greeting.</p>

<p>“Lettice, my love,” said her father, gravely, “do
you know that Mr. Baldwin is the same who helped
our poor Tom to escape from the British ship? Mr.
Baldwin did not know him as the same, under his
assumed name, and, strange as it may seem, I never
connected Mr. Ellicott Baldwin with the young
lieutenant who came so nobly to Tom’s defence, and
I promised Tom that if ever I had the chance I
would try to pay his debt of gratitude; so, Mr. Baldwin,
will you give my daughter your hand—for this
dance?” The start and blush which followed these
words caused Mr. Hopkins to smile.</p>

<p>“Would it tax your generosity beyond its limit to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>ask you to grant my request for a dance, Miss Lettice?”
said Mr. Baldwin, looking at her with all his
soul in his eyes.</p>

<p>She arose immediately, and for the rest of the
evening she was enveloped in an atmosphere of
joy. She forgot that she had not seen her lover,
nor heard from him, in all these months. She was
aware only of a new gladness, of how delightful it
was to have him near her. She did not know
she could be so glad. Once Betty whispered as
she passed them, “You look as happy as the bride
herself, Letty.”</p>

<p>Lettice for answer made a little mouth at her.
She felt all her youth and buoyancy returning to
her, as she found herself once more in the company
of this beloved one and surrounded by the merry
friends of her childhood. To all who knew her
she was the old Lettice of the days before the war,
and her pretty, innocent coquetries but added to
her charm.</p>

<p>“Shall you remain long in the neighborhood?”
Mr. Baldwin asked.</p>

<p>“No, we only came down for the wedding. I
do not know what Brother William and Betty will
do; Uncle Tom wants them to stay at Sylvia’s
Ramble till their new home is built, but I shall
probably go back to town with my father. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
not heard his plans; we have been so busy with
the wedding. Is not Patsey a sweet bride, and
does not Cousin Joe look as if he were in the
seventh heaven? They have been such a devoted
pair of lovers that every one is the more interested
in them, especially as we came so near to losing
Cousin Joe.”</p>

<p>“And you are happy, I hope, Miss Lettice? It
must be a great pleasure for you to see your father
again. You did not expect I would be here to-night,
did you?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“No, I did not.”</p>

<p>“My cousins would have it that I must come
down to spend Christmas, and then nothing would
do but I must stay for this affair. I had to refuse
at first, but Tyler insisted, and when I knew your
father would be here, I consented.” The two looked
at each other, and there was a complete understanding
of the state of affairs without further
explanation.</p>

<p>“Have you been in Washington all this while?”
Lettice asked.</p>

<p>“No, I returned to Boston for a short time. I
made a visit to my sister; she is my only near
relative, you know; and then, as I was not in
sympathy with the Federalist movement, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
so many of my friends up there believed, I thought
I would return to Baltimore and see what I could
do as a landsman. I have been rather hopeless
about my future till now.”</p>

<p>“And now?” The look of interest and loving
sympathy in Lettice’s eyes was almost too much
for the young man’s self-control.</p>

<p>“I am more encouraged,” he told her after a
moment’s pause, in which it seemed to him that
she must hear the wild beating of his heart. “I
shall remain in Baltimore, and may I hope to see
you there? You will be at your uncle’s for the
present?”</p>

<p>“I think so, and—yes, I will be glad to see you
there.” She wondered if he had the faintest idea
of how glad. “Hark, there is twelve o’clock striking,”
she exclaimed; “it is the New Year. I can
be the first to offer you my good wishes. May it
be a happy year to you!”</p>

<p>“May it bring you much joy!” he returned, bending
over and kissing her hand; surely that little
offering of homage might be allowed him on the
occasion of the dawn of a new year.</p>

<p>“Happy New Year!” called one to another.
“Happy New Year!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span></p>

<p>“It is a happy New Year to us, Patsey,” said
Joe, as the last guests departed, and the last lantern
twinkled down the road.</p>

<p>“It is the happiest New Year of my life, Joe,”
said Patsey, lifting her face to his. “My dear,
my dear, suppose you were still languishing in that
terrible prison!” She shuddered and hid her face
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“It is you who wear the fetters now,” said Joe,
playfully, to turn her thoughts from the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I rejoice in my bondage,” said Patsey,
kissing her shining wedding ring. “I glory in
being a slave. I am your willing prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Not my prisoner, but my queen, my wife,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“It is a happy New Year for me,” said Lettice,
cuddling close to her father’s side, as they drove
home together. “What were you and Mr. Baldwin
talking about so long?”</p>

<p>He drew her closer to him under the warm
bearskin robes. “About several things. Is my
little girl so very fond of that young man? And
would it make her very unhappy to give him up?”</p>

<p>“Oh, daddy, dear, you mustn’t ask such personal
questions.”</p>

<p>“But I want to know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span></p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because if he is everything to you, I shall put
into execution a plan I have; otherwise, I might
do something else. You see, he has no future, my
child, unless some one uses influence to give him
a start. I would rather he were a Marylander,
but he cannot help it that he had the misfortune
to be born elsewhere,” he added, laughing. “Now,
the question is: How far shall I use that influence?”</p>

<p>Lettice’s answer came in muffled tones from under
the robes, “Use every particle you possess.”</p>

<p>And her father, with a laugh that turned into a
sigh, returned: “So let it be, my love. Now don’t
ask me any more questions, but let time decide
how it will turn out.” And Lettice was quite
content at this.</p>

<p>The next thing they were all settled down in
Baltimore, and Mr. Baldwin was filling the place
Lettice’s father had always intended for Jamie,
while Lettice realized that this new confidential
clerk was obliged to stop at the house very frequently
upon one pretext or another. So the winter
promised to be a very pleasant one.</p>

<p>The report of the great battle of New Orleans,
with the news of peace, came to end all controversies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>over the war, and the young people of Lettice’s
acquaintance organized a grand sleighing party
in honor of the good news.</p>

<p>Did she ever forget that night? Under the
gleaming stars, well muffled up from the winter’s
cold, she did not feel the sharp, frosty air. From
her quilted hood of silk bordered with swansdown,
her fair little face peeped like a rosebud from a
snowdrift. She snuggled down warmly by the side
of Ellicott Baldwin, who had grown so deft with the
use of his one hand that to drive was no great task.
Over the snow they sped, bells jingling ahead of and
behind them. They talked of many things. It was
not often that they were alone in each other’s company,
and at last the conversation took a new turn.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I said to your father that
last night of the old year? Are you cold, darling?
You shivered then.”</p>

<p>“Did I shiver? No, I am not cold.” She was
trembling at his words. “What did you say?”
she asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“I told him how much I loved his daughter,
and he said that I must not tell you then, but
that if I could make myself a place in business,
as I hoped to do, that he would then be better
able to say whether I might speak to you or not.
And then—how good he is!—he gave me the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
chance to show what I could do. Lettice, am I
presumptuous? Could you? Do you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, here is the bridge! We shall have to stop
and pay toll.” But before the bridge was crossed,
more than one toll was paid.</p>

<p>“I don’t care if he has but one hand,” pouted
Lettice to Betty’s teasing remarks, when the latter
came up for the grand illumination.</p>

<p>“And he is a Yankee.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose he is?”</p>

<p>“And he’ll take you away from your father,
whom you have sworn never to leave.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, then, he will not; for we are all to
live together, and so much the better for my dear
dad. Aha! a valentine! See, Betty! It has come
by a special messenger. Danny found it under the
door. Isn’t it a beauty, with that pretty filigree
paper, and those roses? And what lovely verses!
They are original, I know, for perhaps you are not
aware that my sweetheart has a gift for making
rhymes. Listen:—</p>

<p class="center">“‘LINES TO THE LADY OF MY LOVE.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘God bless thee, dearest, for thy love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whose pure and holy light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon my pathway here below</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hath shed its radiance bright.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">God bless thee for the tenderness</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Midst all the darkness, doubt, and gloom</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Isn’t that lovely, Betty? My Valentine, you
truly are.” And she kissed the verses so rapturously
that Betty laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“It does me good to see you really in love at
last, Lettice. I used to think you ‘quite gone’
when Robert Clinton was with us.”</p>

<p>“Do not speak of that; yet, by the way, what do
you think? Ellicott saw him in Philadelphia last
week, and instead of fighting a duel, as they had
both vowed to when they should next meet, they
actually shook hands over the good news of peace
at last. And Ellicott told him of me, and, so he
says, Mr. Clinton looked quite pale at what he told
him of our engagement, but wished him joy and
congratulated him as bravely as his best friend
would do. He sent me his best wishes, too, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
so I may consider that he has forgiven me. On
top of all this, to-day comes a letter from Rhoda
to Aunt Martha, a dutiful letter, as Rhoda’s
always are. Here it is; I will read you what she
says: ‘My father has long been anxious to make
a match between myself and Robert Clinton,
and so I have consented. Robert and I have a
warm affection for each other and have known
each other from childhood. I think I know all of
his faults as well as his virtues. Each of us has
a past to confess, as you well know, my dear
aunt, but it is a past that can never be recalled,
and I shall not be a less dutiful daughter and wife
because of mine.’”</p>

<p>“Poor Jamie!” sighed Betty.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I am glad of this piece of news. I
shall not care to meet Mr. Robert Clinton again,
but Rhoda I shall always love, and I believe she
loves me.”</p>

<p>And indeed, Rhoda came all the way from Boston
to be Lettice’s bridesmaid, for the wedding took
place in the spring. Lettice declared that she
would never leave her father, and since Joe and
Patsey had come to Baltimore to live, it was high
time that they were leaving her uncle’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>

<p>“Bless me!” said Betty, “we shall be ruined in
preparing for so many weddings; Patsey’s first,
and then yours, before we have taken breath.
Will you come down and be married from our new
house, Lettice? It isn’t as big as the old home,
but it will hold a warm welcome for our friends.
To be sure, we can kill no fatted calf, for all the
British left us is one old ewe, and William and I
are counting upon starting life over again, depending
upon her as our sole prospect of future wealth.”</p>

<p>Lettice laughed. “Patsey might spare you a
goose; she tells me she has already a brood of
young goslings.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to go to Patsey to find a goose,”
replied Betty, saucily; “you haven’t taken your
eyes from that note you just received. I suppose
it is from that precious Yankee of yours. Is it a
receipt for brown bread? Mother promised me
a hen; she actually has two whole ones left, and
if I can get eggs I’ll have some chicks before
long. And father has a heifer which he traded
for, with some old Tory or other, and which he
has promised me. But I can’t promise you any
great fixings, Lettice, dearly as I want to have
you married from our house. Will you come?”</p>

<p>Lettice shook her head. “No, we shall be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>married at St. Paul’s. I think I would rather not
go down again just now, Betty.” And Betty understood.
“There should be no sad memories
to mar the girl’s wedding,” she reflected.</p>

<p>Yet Lettice did go down once more to her old
home, and she stood with her lover in the old
graveyard which had been the scene of so many
experiences.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the night we first came
here together?” Ellicott asked. “I loved you
then and was desperately jealous of Robert
Clinton.”</p>

<p>“Were you really?” said Lettice. She stood
thinking it all over. “You had some reason to
be, sir,” she acknowledged. Then she drew closer
to him. “But there can never be a cause for that
again. No one can ever come between us now,
my beloved.” And what answer he made, only the
mating birds in the trees above them heard.</p>

<p>A pretty wedding it was, with a goodly array of
uniforms to offset the bright gowns. The church
was crowded, many bronzed faces were to be seen,
and more than one empty sleeve. Lutie, carried
away by the occasion, bore her mistress’s train half-way
up the aisle, and when she discovered what
she had done, she retreated, overcome by confusion,
to be scolded by Aunt Hagar, who made her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
first journey to Baltimore to see “Mars Jeems’s
Miss Letty git ma’ied.”</p>

<p>“I prosefy dat match long whiles ergo,” she said
to Mammy who, in all her glory, was in charge of
Betty’s baby, and waiting to ride to church “lak
white folkses.”</p>

<p>“Yass, ma’am, I prosefy dat,” Aunt Hagar
reiterated.</p>

<p>“Go ’long,” said Mammy. “Ennybody prosefy
dat. Hit don’ tek no preacher ner no luck-ball
ter jint dem two f’om de fust. I see dat whilst I
nussin’ him dat time.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Aunt Hagar gave a mighty grunt.
“Ef I ain’ hed de prosefyin’ an’ de ’intment, an’
de cunjurin’ o’ dey inimies, whar yuh reckon dem
young folkses be now?”</p>

<p>But Mammy had no answer to make, for the
carriage was ready, and it was too important an
occasion to spend time in “argyfyin’.”</p>

<p>“Lettice certainly has a lot of friends,” said
Betty, as the carriage bearing the newly wedded
pair drove off. “I believe the entire American
army must have reserved their discarded footwear
to throw after that couple. Did you ever see such
a pile of old shoes?”</p>

<p>A week later Rhoda returned to her home to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
make ready for her own wedding. Lettice kissed
her good-by with more emotion than she believed
possible. Would they ever meet again? Rhoda
herself, looking back through a mist of tears, saw
the picture which ever after remained with her:
a fair young wife in her new home, standing
between husband and father, loyal to both, as she
had always been to the cause for which they had
suffered.</p>
